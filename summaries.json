New subsection 84 (7) allows such a regulation to provide for any aspect of the policy to be subject to the approval of the Minister. SCHEDULE 6 ONTARIO HERITAGE ACT The Schedule amends the Ontario Heritage Act. Here are some highlights. Section 25. 2 of the Act currently permits the Minister to prepare heritage standards and guidelines for the identification, protection, maintenance, use and disposal of property that is owned by the Crown or occupied by a ministry or prescribed public body and that has cultural heritage value or interest. New subsection 25. 2 (3. 1) provides that the process for identifying such properties, as set out in the heritage standards and guidelines, may permit the Minister to review determinations made by a ministry or prescribed public body. New subsection 25. 2 (7) authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to, by order, exempt the Crown, a ministry or a prescribed public body from having to comply with the heritage standards and guidelines in respect of a particular property, if the Lieutenant Governor in Council is of the opinion that such exemption could potentially advance one or more provincial priorities, as specified. Section 27 of the Act currently requires the clerk of each municipality to keep a register that lists all property designated under Part IV of the Act and also all property that has not been designated, but that the municipal council believes to be of cultural heritage value or interest. New subsection 27 (1. 1) requires the clerk of the municipality to ensure that the information included in the register is accessible to the public on the municipality\u2019s website. Subsection 27 (3) is re-enacted to require that non-designated property must meet the criteria for determining whether property is of cultural heritage value or interest, if such criteria are prescribed. Current subsection 27 (13) is re-enacted to provide that, in addition to applying to properties included in the register on and after July 1, 2021, the objection process set out in subsections 27 (7) and (8) apply to non-designated properties that were included in the register as of June 30, 2021. New subsections 27 (14), (15) and (16) specify circumstances that require the removal of non-designated property from the register. New subsection 27 (18) prevents a council from including such non-designated property in the register again for five years. Currently, subsection 29 (1. 2) of the Act provides that, if a prescribed event occurs, a notice of intention to designate a property under that section may not be given after 90 days have elapsed from the prescribed event, subject to such exceptions as may be prescribed. The subsection is re-enacted to also provide that the municipality may give a notice of intention to designate the property only if the property was included in the register under subsection 27 (3) as of the date of the prescribed event. Subsection 41 (1) of the Act currently permits a council of a municipality to designate, by by-law, the municipality or any defined area of it as a heritage conversation district, if there is in effect in the municipality an official plan that contains provisions relating to the establishment of a heritage conservation district. The subsection is re-enacted to also require the municipality or defined area or areas to meet criteria for determining whether they are of cultural heritage value or interest, if such criteria are prescribed. New subsections 41 (10. 2) and (10. 3) require a council of a municipality wishing to amend or repeal a by-law made under the section to do so in accordance with such process as may be prescribed; similar rules are added to section 41. 1. Section 71 of the Act authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations governing transitional matters to facilitate the implementation of the amendments made in the Schedule. Other housekeeping amendments are made to the Act. SCHEDULE 7 ONTARIO LAND TRIBUNAL ACT, 2021 The Schedule amends the Ontario Land Tribunal Act, 2021. Subsection 19 (1) is amended to expand the Tribunal\u2019s powers to dismiss a proceeding without a hearing, on the basis that the party who brought the proceeding has contributed to undue delay. Section 19 of the Act is also amended to give the Tribunal the power to dismiss a proceeding entirely, if the Tribunal is of the opinion that a party has failed to comply with a Tribunal order. Section 20 is amended to give the Tribunal the power to order an unsuccessful party to pay a successful party\u2019s costs. The regulation-making authority in section 29 is also amended. The Lieutenant Governor in Council is given authority to make regulations requiring the Tribunal to prioritize the resolution of specified classes of proceedings. The Minister is given authority to make regulations prescribing timelines that would apply to specified steps taken by the Tribunal in specified classes of proceedings. The implications of a failure of the Tribunal to comply with the timelines prescribed by the Minister are addressed, and the Minister is given authority to require the Tribunal to report on its compliance with the timelines. A consequential amendment is made to subsection 13 (4). SCHEDULE 8 ONTARIO UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ACT, 2012 The Schedule amends the Ontario Underground Infrastructure Notification System Act, 2012.  Here are some highlights:  1.  New subsection 2 (4. 4) authorizes the Minister to appoint a chair of the board of directors.   2.  New section 2. 3 authorizes the Minister to appoint an administrator of the Corporation.  This section sets out details of this appointment such as the term, powers and duties of the administrator and various rules with respect to liability.  New section 2. 5 sets out the conditions to be satisfied in order for the Minister to exercise this authority.   3.  New section 2. 4 sets out that the members of the board of directors of the Corporation cease to hold office during an administrator\u2019s tenure, unless otherwise specified.  This section sets out the status of the board during an administrator\u2019s tenure.   4.  New section 2. 6 sets out that the Act, the regulations and Minister\u2019s orders prevail in the event of a conflict with the memorandum of understanding or the Corporation\u2019s by-laws and resolutions. SCHEDULE 9 PLANNING ACT The Schedule makes various amendments to the Planning Act. Here are some highlights:  1.  The concept of parcels of urban residential land is added as well as rules respecting development on such parcels.   2.  New subsections 16 (20) and (21) are added to require zoning by-laws to be amended to conform with certain official plan policies within one year of the policies coming into effect.   3.  Currently, under subsection 45 (12), a person has the right to appeal a decision of the committee of adjustment if the person has an interest in the matter. Amendments are made to the subsection to add the requirement that the person also be a specified person listed in a new definition in subsection 1 (1). New subsections 45 (12. 1) to (12. 4) are added to provide transitional rules associated with this change, including its retroactive application. A similar amendment is made to appeal rights under subsections 53 (19) and (27).   4.  Currently, subsections 22 (2. 1) to (2. 1. 2) prohibit requests for official plan amendments to be made within two years of a new official plan or secondary plan coming into effect. The subsections are repealed.  The prohibitions on applications to amend zoning by-laws in subsections 34 (10. 0. 0. 1) and (10. 0. 0. 2) and in relation to applications for a minor variance in subsections 45 (1. 2) to (1. 4) are similarly repealed.   5.  Currently, section 23 of the Act enables the Minister to amend official plans by order where the plan is likely to adversely affect a matter of provincial interest. This section is re-enacted to, in particular, eliminate certain procedural steps to which the Minister\u2019s power to make orders is subject, as well as to remove the possibility of the Minister requesting that the Tribunal hold a hearing on a proposed amendment.   6.  A new subsection 34 (19. 9) is added to create an exception to subsection 34 (19. 5), which prevents certain appeals of zoning by-laws related to protected major transit station areas if more than a year has passed since related official plan policies or amendments thereto came into effect.   7.  Currently, subsection 37 (6) permits a municipality that has passed a community benefits charge by-law to allow an owner of land to provide the municipality facilities, services or matters required because of development or redevelopment in the area.  A new subsection 37 (7. 1) provides that a municipality may require such an owner to enter into an agreement with the municipality that addresses the provision of the facilities, services or matters and new subsection (7. 2) requires the agreement to be registered against the land.   8.  Currently, subsection 37 (32) of the Act provides that the amount of a community benefits charge payable in any particular case shall not exceed the prescribed percentage of the value of the land as of the valuation date. The subsection is amended to require the amount to be multiplied by a ratio based on floor area.   9.  Various amendments are made to section 41 of the Act with respect to site plan control areas. New subsections (1. 2) and (1. 3) are added to qualify the definition of \u201cdevelopment\u201d in section 41. Amendments to subsections (4) and (4. 1) provide that exterior design is no longer a matter that is subject to site plan control. Similar changes are made to section 47. 10.  Various amendments are made to section 42 of the Act with respect to parkland requirements, including the following:      i.  Currently subsection 42 (1) provides that a council may require the dedication of land for park or other public recreational purposes as a condition of development or redevelopment and sets out maximum amounts based on the type of development or redevelopment. A new subsection 42 (1. 1) is added to establish a maximum amount for development or redevelopment that will include affordable residential units, attainable residential units or residential units required to be affordable pursuant to an inclusionary zoning by-law. Similar changes are made to section 51. 1.      ii.  New subsections 42 (2. 1) to (2. 4) are added, which set out rules with respect to the timing of the determination of the amount of land for park or other public recreational purposes or payment in lieu that is required to be provided under a by-law under the section. Similar changes are made to section 51. 1.      iii.  Amendments are made in relation to the alternative requirement for parkland conveyances and payments in lieu, including to change the maximum rates and provide a maximum amount of land or value thereof that may be required to be provided. Similar changes are made to section 51. 1.     iv.  New subsections 42 (4. 30) to (4. 39) are added, which set out a framework for owners of land to identify land to be conveyed to satisfy requirements of a by-law passed under the section. The framework permits owners to appeal to the Tribunal if the municipality refuses to accept the conveyance of the identified land.      v.  A new subsection 42 (16. 1) is added, which requires a municipality to spend or allocate 60 per cent of the monies in the special account required by subsection 42 (15) annually. 11.  Amendments to the exceptions to subdivision control and part-lot control under subsections 50 (3) and (5) of the Act are made in connection with land lease community homes. The exception doesn\u2019t apply in respect of land if any part of the land is in the Greenbelt Area. A complementary amendment is made to the definition of \u201cparcel of land\u201d in subsection 46 (1). 12.  Section 51 is amended by repealing certain provisions respecting public meetings. 13.  Section 70. 12 is added to give the Minister the power to make regulations governing transitional matters. 14.  The Act is amended to provide for two different classes of upper-tier municipalities, those which have planning responsibilities and those which do not. Various amendments are made to provide lower-tier municipalities with planning functions where, for municipal purposes, they form part of an upper-tier municipality without planning responsibilities. A new section 70. 13 addresses various transitional matters which may arise where there is a change in the municipality that has planning responsibilities. SCHEDULE 10 SUPPORTING GROWTH AND HOUSING IN YORK AND DURHAM REGIONS ACT, 2022 The Supporting Growth and Housing in York and Durham Regions Act, 2022 is enacted.

Bill 71 has been enacted as Chapter 6 of the Statutes of Ontario, 2023. The Bill amends the Mining Act. The Act is amended to provide for certain powers exercised by public servants appointed for the purpose to be exercised by the Minister of Mines instead:  1.  Section 78 is amended to permit the Minister to exercise any power and perform any duty of a Director of Exploration under the Act in place of the Director.   2.  Part VII is amended to remove the position of Director of Mine Rehabilitation and to give the powers and duties of the Director of Mine Rehabilitation to the Minister. A number of amendments are made to the French version of the Act to reflect the change. Most of the remaining amendments in the Bill are made to or are in relation to Part VII of the Act (Rehabilitation of Mining Lands), including the following:  1.  The definition of \u201crehabilitate\u201d in subsection 139 (1) is re-enacted to provide for different rehabilitation outcomes. Complementary amendments are made to the definition of \u201cprotective measures\u201d, which forms part of rehabilitation.   2.  Section 140 is amended to provide that a closure plan respecting advanced exploration may be filed even if it does not meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations, if the proponent obtains an order from the Minister permitting the filing. The order must provide that the outstanding requirements be met within the period specified by the Minister in the order, and may be subject to further terms and conditions that the Minister may include in the order. Similar amendments are made to section 141 in relation to the filing of a closure plan respecting mine production and to section 143 in relation to the filing of an amendment to a filed closure plan.   3.  Provisions are added to sections 140, 141 and 143 to expressly provide that regulations setting out the requirements for a submitted closure plan or amendment to a closure plan may require that a statement to be included in the closure plan or amendment be certified by a qualified person or other individual specified by the regulations.

Subsection 144 (2) of the Act is re-enacted to limit the number of circumstances in which a proponent must give notice of a material change in respect of a project.   5.

A new subsection 145 (6. 3) provides that if the Minister approves a change to the financial assurance in a proponent\u2019s closure plan, an amendment to the closure plan indicating the change is deemed to have been filed. This removes any need for the proponent to propose an amendment to the filed closure plan under section 143 respecting the change.   7.  Subsections 145 (2) to (5), dealing with the realization of security on the basis that a rehabilitation measure has not or will not be carried out, are re-enacted as a new section 146.   8.

Subsection 153. 2 (7) is enacted so that, if the Minister transfers a proponent\u2019s filed closure plan to another person, an amendment to the closure plan indicating the transfer is deemed to have been filed. This removes any need for a person to propose an amendment to the filed closure plan under section 143 respecting the transfer.

Application of Act to decision recognized under Convention elsewhere in Canada 19 (1) This Act applies with respect to a decision made in a Contracting State that has been registered and is enforceable in another jurisdiction of Canada under an Act of that jurisdiction that adopts the Convention. Exception, challenge or appeal (2) Despite subsection (1), no challenge or appeal of the registration of the decision under this Act may be brought under Article 23 (5) of the Convention, regardless of whether or not any such challenge or appeal was brought in the other jurisdiction, unless the respondent did not receive notice of the application for recognition and enforcement in the other jurisdiction of Canada in which the decision was previously registered for enforcement.

Article 15 Free legal assistance for child support applications 1 The requested State shall provide free legal assistance in respect of all applications by a creditor under this Chapter concerning maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a person under the age of 21 years. 2 Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the requested State may, in relation to applications other than those under Article 10(1) a) and b) and the cases covered by Article 20(4), refuse free legal assistance if it considers that, on the merits, the application or any appeal is manifestly unfounded. Article 16 Declaration to permit use of child-centred means test 1 Notwithstanding Article 15(1), a State may declare, in accordance with Article 63, that it will provide free legal assistance in respect of applications other than under Article 10(1) a) and b) and the cases covered by Article 20(4), subject to a test based on an assessment of the means of the child. 2 A State shall, at the time of making such a declaration, provide information to the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law concerning the manner in which the assessment of the child\u2019s means will be carried out, including the financial criteria which would need to be met to satisfy the test. 3 An application referred to in paragraph 1, addressed to a State which has made the declaration referred to in that paragraph, shall include a formal attestation by the applicant stating that the child\u2019s means meet the criteria referred to in paragraph 2. The requested State may only request further evidence of the child\u2019s means if it has reasonable grounds to believe that the information provided by the applicant is inaccurate. 4 If the most favourable legal assistance provided for by the law of the requested State in respect of applications under this Chapter concerning maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a child is more favourable than that provided for under paragraphs 1 to 3, the most favourable legal assistance shall be provided. Article 17 Applications not qualifying under Article 15 or Article 16 In the case of all applications under this Convention other than those under Article 15 or Article 16 \u2013  a) the provision of free legal assistance may be made subject to a means or a merits test;  b) an applicant, who in the State of origin has benefited from free legal assistance, shall be entitled, in any proceedings for recognition or enforcement, to benefit, at least to the same extent, from free legal assistance as provided for by the law of the State addressed under the same circumstances. CHAPTER IV RESTRICTIONS ON BRINGING PROCEEDINGS Article 18 Limit on proceedings 1 Where a decision is made in a Contracting State where the creditor is habitually resident, proceedings to modify the decision or to make a new decision cannot be brought by the debtor in any other Contracting State as long as the creditor remains habitually resident in the State where the decision was made. 2 Paragraph 1 shall not apply \u2013  a) where, except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there is agreement in writing between the parties to the jurisdiction of that other Contracting State;  b) where the creditor submits to the jurisdiction of that other Contracting State either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity;  c) where the competent authority in the State of origin cannot, or refuses to, exercise jurisdiction to modify the decision or make a new decision; or  d) where the decision made in the State of origin cannot be recognised or declared enforceable in the Contracting State where proceedings to modify the decision or make a new decision are contemplated. CHAPTER V RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT Article 19 Scope of the Chapter 1 This Chapter shall apply to a decision rendered by a judicial or administrative authority in respect of a maintenance obligation. The term \u201cdecision\u201d also includes a settlement or agreement concluded before or approved by such an authority. A decision may include automatic adjustment by indexation and a requirement to pay arrears, retroactive maintenance or interest and a determination of costs or expenses. 2 If a decision does not relate solely to a maintenance obligation, the effect of this Chapter is limited to the parts of the decision which concern maintenance obligations. 3 For the purpose of paragraph 1, \u201cadministrative authority\u201d means a public body whose decisions, under the law of the State where it is established \u2013  a) may be made the subject of an appeal to or review by a judicial authority; and  b) have a similar force and effect to a decision of a judicial authority on the same matter. 4 This Chapter also applies to maintenance arrangements in accordance with Article 30. 5 The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to a request for recognition and enforcement made directly to a competent authority of the State addressed in accordance with Article 37. Article 20 Bases for recognition and enforcement 1 A decision made in one Contracting State (\u201cthe State of origin\u201d) shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States if \u2013  a) the respondent was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted;  b) the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity;  c) the creditor was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted;  d) the child for whom maintenance was ordered was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted, provided that the respondent has lived with the child in that State or has resided in that State and provided support for the child there;  e) except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there has been agreement to the jurisdiction in writing by the parties; or   f) the decision was made by an authority exercising jurisdiction on a matter of personal status or parental responsibility, unless that jurisdiction was based solely on the nationality of one of the parties. 2 A Contracting State may make a reservation, in accordance with Article 62, in respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f). 3 A Contracting State making a reservation under paragraph 2 shall recognise and enforce a decision if its law would in similar factual circumstances confer or would have conferred jurisdiction on its authorities to make such a decision. 4 A Contracting State shall, if recognition of a decision is not possible as a result of a reservation under paragraph 2, and if the debtor is habitually resident in that State, take all appropriate measures to establish a decision for the benefit of the creditor. The preceding sentence shall not apply to direct requests for recognition and enforcement under Article 19(5) or to claims for support referred to in Article 2(1) b). 5 A decision in favour of a child under the age of 18 years which cannot be recognised by virtue only of a reservation in respect of paragraph 1 c), e) or f) shall be accepted as establishing the eligibility of that child for maintenance in the State addressed. 6 A decision shall be recognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and shall be enforced only if it is enforceable in the State of origin. Article 21 Severability and partial recognition and enforcement 1 If the State addressed is unable to recognise or enforce the whole of the decision, it shall recognise or enforce any severable part of the decision which can be so recognised or enforced. 2 Partial recognition or enforcement of a decision can always be applied for. Article 22 Grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement Recognition and enforcement of a decision may be refused if \u2013  a) recognition and enforcement of the decision is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (\u201cordre public\u201d) of the State addressed;  b) the decision was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;  c) proceedings between the same parties and having the same purpose are pending before an authority of the State addressed and those proceedings were the first to be instituted;  d) the decision is incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties and having the same purpose, either in the State addressed or in another State, provided that this latter decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition and enforcement in the State addressed;  e) in a case where the respondent has neither appeared nor was represented in proceedings in the State of origin \u2013      i) when the law of the State of origin provides for notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, or      ii) when the law of the State of origin does not provide for notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the decision and an opportunity to challenge or appeal it on fact and law; or   f) the decision was made in violation of Article 18. Article 23 Procedure on an application for recognition and enforcement 1 Subject to the provisions of the Convention, the procedures for recognition and enforcement shall be governed by the law of the State addressed. 2 Where an application for recognition and enforcement of a decision has been made through Central Authorities in accordance with Chapter III, the requested Central Authority shall promptly either \u2013  a) refer the application to the competent authority which shall without delay declare the decision enforceable or register the decision for enforcement; or  b) if it is the competent authority take such steps itself. 3 Where the request is made directly to a competent authority in the State addressed in accordance with Article 19(5), that authority shall without delay declare the decision enforceable or register the decision for enforcement. 4 A declaration or registration may be refused only on the ground set out in Article 22 a). At this stage neither the applicant nor the respondent is entitled to make any submissions. 5 The applicant and the respondent shall be promptly notified of the declaration or registration, made under paragraphs 2 and 3, or the refusal thereof in accordance with paragraph 4, and may bring a challenge or appeal on fact and on a point of law. 6 A challenge or an appeal is to be lodged within 30 days of notification under paragraph 5. If the contesting party is not resident in the Contracting State in which the declaration or registration was made or refused, the challenge or appeal shall be lodged within 60 days of notification. 7 A challenge or appeal may be founded only on the following \u2013  a) the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement set out in Article 22;  b) the bases for recognition and enforcement under Article 20;  c) the authenticity or integrity of any document transmitted in accordance with Article 25(1) a), b) or d) or (3) b). 8 A challenge or an appeal by a respondent may also be founded on the fulfilment of the debt to the extent that the recognition and enforcement relates to payments that fell due in the past. 9 The applicant and the respondent shall be promptly notified of the decision following the challenge or the appeal. 10 A further appeal, if permitted by the law of the State addressed, shall not have the effect of staying the enforcement of the decision unless there are exceptional circumstances. 11 In taking any decision on recognition and enforcement, including any appeal, the competent authority shall act expeditiously. Article 24 Alternative procedure on an application for recognition and enforcement 1 Notwithstanding Article 23(2) to (11), a State may declare, in accordance with Article 63, that it will apply the procedure for recognition and enforcement set out in this Article. 2 Where an application for recognition and enforcement of a decision has been made through Central Authorities in accordance with Chapter III, the requested Central Authority shall promptly either \u2013  a) refer the application to the competent authority which shall decide on the application for recognition and enforcement; or  b) if it is the competent authority, take such a decision itself. 3 A decision on recognition and enforcement shall be given by the competent authority after the respondent has been duly and promptly notified of the proceedings and both parties have been given an adequate opportunity to be heard. 4 The competent authority may review the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement set out in Article 22 a), c) and d) of its own motion. It may review any grounds listed in Articles 20, 22 and 23(7) c) if raised by the respondent or if concerns relating to those grounds arise from the face of the documents submitted in accordance with Article 25. 5 A refusal of recognition and enforcement may also be founded on the fulfilment of the debt to the extent that the recognition and enforcement relates to payments that fell due in the past. 6 Any appeal, if permitted by the law of the State addressed, shall not have the effect of staying the enforcement of the decision unless there are exceptional circumstances. 7 In taking any decision on recognition and enforcement, including any appeal, the competent authority shall act expeditiously. Article 25Documents 1 An application for recognition and enforcement under Article 23 or Article 24 shall be accompanied by the following \u2013  a) a complete text of the decision;  b) a document stating that the decision is enforceable in the State of origin and, in the case of a decision by an administrative authority, a document stating that the requirements of Article 19(3) are met unless that State has specified in accordance with Article 57 that decisions of its administrative authorities always meet those requirements;  c) if the respondent did not appear and was not represented in the proceedings in the State of origin, a document or documents attesting, as appropriate, either that the respondent had proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, or that the respondent had proper notice of the decision and the opportunity to challenge or appeal it on fact and law;  d) where necessary, a document showing the amount of any arrears and the date such amount was calculated;  e) where necessary, in the case of a decision providing for automatic adjustment by indexation, a document providing the information necessary to make the appropriate calculations;   f) where necessary, documentation showing the extent to which the applicant received free legal assistance in the State of origin. 2 Upon a challenge or appeal under Article 23(7) c) or upon request by the competent authority in the State addressed, a complete copy of the document concerned, certified by the competent authority in the State of origin, shall be provided promptly \u2013  a) by the Central Authority of the requesting State, where the application has been made in accordance with Chapter III;  b) by the applicant, where the request has been made directly to a competent authority of the State addressed. 3 A Contracting State may specify in accordance with Article 57 \u2013  a) that a complete copy of the decision certified by the competent authority in the State of origin must accompany the application;  b) circumstances in which it will accept, in lieu of a complete text of the decision, an abstract or extract of the decision drawn up by the competent authority of the State of origin, which may be made in the form recommended and published by the Hague Conference on Private International Law; or  c) that it does not require a document stating that the requirements of Article 19(3) are met. Article 26Procedure on an application for recognition This Chapter shall apply mutatis mutandis to an application for recognition of a decision, save that the requirement of enforceability is replaced by the requirement that the decision has effect in the State of origin. Article 27 Findings of fact Any competent authority of the State addressed shall be bound by the findings of fact on which the authority of the State of origin based its jurisdiction. Article 28 No review of the merits There shall be no review by any competent authority of the State addressed of the merits of a decision.

Article 31 Decisions produced by the combined effect of provisional and confirmation orders Where a decision is produced by the combined effect of a provisional order made in one State and an order by an authority in another State (\u201cthe confirming State\u201d) confirming the provisional order \u2013  a) each of those States shall be deemed for the purposes of this Chapter to be a State of origin;  b) the requirements of Article 22 e) shall be met if the respondent had proper notice of the proceedings in the confirming State and an opportunity to oppose the confirmation of the provisional order;  c) the requirement of Article 20(6) that a decision be enforceable in the State of origin shall be met if the decision is enforceable in the confirming State; and  d) Article 18 shall not prevent proceedings for the modification of the decision being commenced in either State. CHAPTER VI ENFORCEMENT BY THE STATE ADDRESSED Article 32 Enforcement under internal law 1 Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, enforcement shall take place in accordance with the law of the State addressed. 2 Enforcement shall be prompt. 3 In the case of applications through Central Authorities, where a decision has been declared enforceable or registered for enforcement under Chapter V, enforcement shall proceed without the need for further action by the applicant. 4 Effect shall be given to any rules applicable in the State of origin of the decision relating to the duration of the maintenance obligation. 5 Any limitation on the period for which arrears may be enforced shall be determined either by the law of the State of origin of the decision or by the law of the State addressed, whichever provides for the longer limitation period. Article 33 Non-discrimination The State addressed shall provide at least the same range of enforcement methods for cases under the Convention as are available in domestic cases.

Article 35 Transfer of funds 1 Contracting States are encouraged to promote, including by means of international agreements, the use of the most cost-effective and efficient methods available to transfer funds payable as maintenance. 2 A Contracting State, under whose law the transfer of funds is restricted, shall accord the highest priority to the transfer of funds payable under this Convention. CHAPTER VII PUBLIC BODIES Article 36 Public bodies as applicants 1 For the purposes of applications for recognition and enforcement under Article 10(1) a) and b) and cases covered by Article 20(4), \u201ccreditor\u201d includes a public body acting in place of an individual to whom maintenance is owed or one to which reimbursement is owed for benefits provided in place of maintenance. 2 The right of a public body to act in place of an individual to whom maintenance is owed or to seek reimbursement of benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance shall be governed by the law to which the body is subject. 3 A public body may seek recognition or claim enforcement of \u2013  a) a decision rendered against a debtor on the application of a public body which claims payment of benefits provided in place of maintenance;  b) a decision rendered between a creditor and debtor to the extent of the benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance. 4 The public body seeking recognition or claiming enforcement of a decision shall upon request furnish any document necessary to establish its right under paragraph 2 and that benefits have been provided to the creditor. CHAPTER VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 37 Direct requests to competent authorities 1 The Convention shall not exclude the possibility of recourse to such procedures as may be available under the internal law of a Contracting State allowing a person (an applicant) to seize directly a competent authority of that State in a matter governed by the Convention including, subject to Article 18, for the purpose of having a maintenance decision established or modified. 2 Articles 14(5) and 17 b) and the provisions of Chapters V, VI, VII and this Chapter, with the exception of Articles 40(2), 42, 43(3), 44(3), 45 and 55, shall apply in relation to a request for recognition and enforcement made directly to a competent authority in a Contracting State. 3 For the purpose of paragraph 2, Article 2(1) a) shall apply to a decision granting maintenance to a vulnerable person over the age specified in that sub-paragraph where such decision was rendered before the person reached that age and provided for maintenance beyond that age by reason of the impairment. Article 38 Protection of personal data Personal data gathered or transmitted under the Convention shall be used only for the purposes for which they were gathered or transmitted. Article 39 Confidentiality Any authority processing information shall ensure its confidentiality in accordance with the law of its State. Article 40 Non-disclosure of information 1 An authority shall not disclose or confirm information gathered or transmitted in application of this Convention if it determines that to do so could jeopardise the health, safety or liberty of a person. 2 A determination to this effect made by one Central Authority shall be taken into account by another Central Authority, in particular in cases of family violence. 3 Nothing in this Article shall impede the gathering and transmitting of information by and between authorities in so far as necessary to carry out the obligations under the Convention. Article 41 No legalisation No legalisation or similar formality may be required in the context of this Convention.

Article 44 Language requirements 1 Any application and related documents shall be in the original language, and shall be accompanied by a translation into an official language of the requested State or another language which the requested State has indicated, by way of declaration in accordance with Article 63, it will accept, unless the competent authority of that State dispenses with translation. 2 A Contracting State which has more than one official language and cannot, for reasons of internal law, accept for the whole of its territory documents in one of those languages shall, by declaration in accordance with Article 63, specify the language in which such documents or translations thereof shall be drawn up for submission in the specified parts of its territory. 3 Unless otherwise agreed by the Central Authorities, any other communications between such Authorities shall be in an official language of the requested State or in either English or French. However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 62, object to the use of either English or French. Article 45 Means and costs of translation 1 In the case of applications under Chapter III, the Central Authorities may agree in an individual case or generally that the translation into an official language of the requested State may be made in the requested State from the original language or from any other agreed language. If there is no agreement and it is not possible for the requesting Central Authority to comply with the requirements of Article 44(1) and (2), then the application and related documents may be transmitted with translation into English or French for further translation into an official language of the requested State. 2 The cost of translation arising from the application of paragraph 1 shall be borne by the requesting State unless otherwise agreed by Central Authorities of the States concerned. 3 Notwithstanding Article 8, the requesting Central Authority may charge an applicant for the costs of translation of an application and related documents, except in so far as those costs may be covered by its system of legal assistance.

Article 47Non-unified legal systems \u2013 substantive rules 1 A Contracting State with two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply shall not be bound to apply this Convention to situations which involve solely such different territorial units. 2 A competent authority in a territorial unit of a Contracting State with two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply shall not be bound to recognise or enforce a decision from another Contracting State solely because the decision has been recognised or enforced in another territorial unit of the same Contracting State under this Convention. 3 This Article shall not apply to a Regional Economic Integration Organisation. Article 48 Co-ordination with prior Hague Maintenance Conventions In relations between the Contracting States, this Convention replaces, subject to Article 56(2), the Hague Convention of 2 October 1973 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations and the Hague Convention of 15 April 1958 concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions relating to maintenance obligations towards children in so far as their scope of application as between such States coincides with the scope of application of this Convention. Article 49 Co-ordination with the 1956 New York Convention In relations between the Contracting States, this Convention replaces the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance of 20 June 1956, in so far as its scope of application as between such States coincides with the scope of application of this Convention. Article 50 Relationship with prior Hague Conventions on service of documents and taking of evidence This Convention does not affect the Hague Convention of 1 March 1954 on civil procedure, the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters and the Hague Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters. Article 51 Co-ordination of instruments and supplementary agreements 1 This Convention does not affect any international instrument concluded before this Convention to which Contracting States are Parties and which contains provisions on matters governed by this Convention. 2 Any Contracting State may conclude with one or more Contracting States agreements, which contain provisions on matters governed by the Convention, with a view to improving the application of the Convention between or among themselves, provided that such agreements are consistent with the objects and purpose of the Convention and do not affect, in the relationship of such States with other Contracting States, the application of the provisions of the Convention. The States which have concluded such an agreement shall transmit a copy to the depositary of the Convention. 3 Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to reciprocity arrangements and to uniform laws based on special ties between the States concerned. 4 This Convention shall not affect the application of instruments of a Regional Economic Integration Organisation that is a Party to this Convention, adopted after the conclusion of the Convention, on matters governed by the Convention provided that such instruments do not affect, in the relationship of Member States of the Regional Economic Integration Organisation with other Contracting States, the application of the provisions of the Convention.

Article 52 Most effective rule 1 This Convention shall not prevent the application of an agreement, arrangement or international instrument in force between the requesting State and the requested State, or a reciprocity arrangement in force in the requested State that provides for \u2013  a) broader bases for recognition of maintenance decisions, without prejudice to Article 22 f) of the Convention;  b) simplified, more expeditious procedures on an application for recognition or recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions;  c) more beneficial legal assistance than that provided for under Articles 14 to 17; or  d) procedures permitting an applicant from a requesting State to make a request directly to the Central Authority of the requested State. 2 This Convention shall not prevent the application of a law in force in the requested State that provides for more effective rules as referred to in paragraph 1 a) to c). However, as regards simplified, more expeditious procedures referred to in paragraph 1 b), they must be compatible with the protection offered to the parties under Articles 23 and 24, in particular as regards the rights of the parties to be duly notified of the proceedings and be given adequate opportunity to be heard and as regards the effects of any challenge or appeal. Article 53 Uniform interpretation In the interpretation of this Convention, regard shall be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application.

Article 56 Transitional provisions 1 The Convention shall apply in every case where \u2013  a) a request pursuant to Article 7 or an application pursuant to Chapter III has been received by the Central Authority of the requested State after the Convention has entered into force between the requesting State and the requested State;  b) a direct request for recognition and enforcement has been received by the competent authority of the State addressed after the Convention has entered into force between the State of origin and the State addressed. 2 With regard to the recognition and enforcement of decisions between Contracting States to this Convention that are also Parties to either of the Hague Maintenance Conventions mentioned in Article 48, if the conditions for the recognition and enforcement under this Convention prevent the recognition and enforcement of a decision given in the State of origin before the entry into force of this Convention for that State, that would otherwise have been recognised and enforced under the terms of the Convention that was in effect at the time the decision was rendered, the conditions of that Convention shall apply. 3 The State addressed shall not be bound under this Convention to enforce a decision or a maintenance arrangement, in respect of payments falling due prior to the entry into force of the Convention between the State of origin and the State addressed, except for maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a person under the age of 21 years.

Subsection 41 (11. 1) currently provides for circumstances in which a municipality is required to refund fees for processing an application for the approval of plans and drawings that are submitted on or after January 1, 2023.

SCHEDULE 7 RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES ACT, 2006 The Schedule makes various amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, including the following amendments:  1.  Part IV is amended to add section 36. 1, which permits tenants to install and use a window or portable air conditioner in a rental unit for which the landlord does not supply air conditioning, subject to specified exceptions and conditions. In cases where the landlord is obligated under the tenancy agreement to supply electricity to the rental unit, the landlord may increase the rent charged to the tenant, subject to the tenancy agreement providing otherwise. Rules are set out requiring rent decreases if a tenant seasonally ceases to use an air conditioner, or removes it. Certain provisions of the section are made to apply to previously-installed window or portable air conditioners.   2.  Subsection 50 (3) is re-enacted to provide that when a landlord gives notice of termination of a tenancy because the landlord requires possession of a rental unit in order to do repairs or renovations to it that are so extensive that they require a building permit and vacant possession, the notice must be accompanied by a report prepared by a person who has the prescribed qualifications, which states that the repairs or renovations are so extensive that they require the vacant possession and which meets any other prescribed requirements. Failure to meet the requirement renders the notice void. Subsection 73 (4) is enacted to require the Board to consider the report when determining whether to make an order terminating the tenancy, although the Board is not bound by the report.   3.  Currently, under section 53, a tenant who receives notice of termination of a tenancy for the purpose of repairs or renovations may have a right of first refusal to occupy the rental unit as a tenant when the repairs or renovations are completed. The section is amended to provide that, if a tenant gives notice that they wish to have a right of first refusal, the landlord must provide specified notices to the tenant respecting the unit\u2019s readiness for occupancy. When the unit is ready for occupancy, the landlord must give the tenant at least 60 days to exercise the right of first refusal to occupy the unit. Section 57. 1 is amended to provide that a failure to comply with the notice requirements is deemed to constitute a failure to have afforded a right of first refusal for the purposes of subsection 57. 1 (1) (former tenant\u2019s application, failure to afford tenant right of first refusal). Section 57. 1 is also amended to change the time limit applicable to the making of an application under subsection 57. 1 (1).   4.  Currently, under clause 57 (1) (a), the Board may make various orders if the Board determines that, among other things, a landlord has given a notice of termination under section 48 in bad faith and no person referred to in clause 48 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) occupied the rental unit within a reasonable time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit. New subsection 57 (6. 1) provides that if none of the specified persons occupied the rental unit within the prescribed period of time after the former tenant vacated the rental unit, it is presumed that the landlord gave the notice of termination in bad faith and that the rental unit was not occupied within a reasonable time.   5.  Subsection 206 (1) is amended to require that the written agreement reached between the landlord and the tenant to resolve the subject-matter of an application to the Board be in the form approved by the Board.   6.  Section 238 is amended to increase the maximum fines from $50,000 to $100,000 in the case of a person other than a corporation and from $250,000 to $500,000 in the case of a corporation.", "bill-98": "bill-98 -- Bill 98 | Title: Better Schools and Student Outcomes Act, 2023 | Sponsor: Lecce, Hon.

The Schedule amends these provisions to provide that the purpose of such an entry and search is to determine whether to exercise powers under sections 30 to 33.   2.  New provisions are added to the Act to impose requirements on the owner or custodian of an animal that is the subject of an order under section 30.

SCHEDULE 1 CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2023 The Schedule repeals the Consumer Protection Act, 2002 and enacts the Consumer Protection Act, 2023 in its place. The new Consumer Protection Act, 2023 is, like the current Consumer Protection Act, 2002, divided into Parts.  The following are the highlights of each Part. Part I sets out definitions that are used throughout the Act and provides that, subject to any prescribed exceptions, the Act applies to consumer transactions if the consumer or the person engaging in the transaction with the consumer is located in Ontario when the transaction takes place.  Other general rules are set out in Part I, including that information required under the Act to be disclosed by a supplier must be clear, comprehensible and prominent and that ambiguities in any consumer contract provided by the supplier or in information that must be disclosed under the Act are to be interpreted to the benefit of the consumer. Part II deals with fair marketplace rules.  The Part prohibits unfair practices; namely, making false, misleading or deceptive representations, making unconscionable representations and engaging in unconscionable acts.  Examples of unfair practices are provided, such as failing to state a material fact or charging a price that grossly exceeds the price of similar goods or services available from similar suppliers.  The Part also prohibits the inclusion of certain terms and acknowledgements in consumer contracts and sets out rules regarding unsolicited goods or services, estimates and deemed warranties. Part III applies to various consumer contracts: contracts in respect of which delivery, performance or payment in full is not made when the parties enter into the contract, contracts entered into when the consumer and supplier are not present together and direct contracts.  Certain exceptions are provided.  The Part governs various rules in relation to these contracts: disclosure, content, delivery, amendments and continuations.  Suppliers are prohibited from soliciting consumers to enter into prescribed consumer contracts or entering into such contracts while at the consumer\u2019s dwelling, unless prescribed conditions are satisfied.  Specific requirements are imposed in respect of certain types of consumer contracts, including purchase-cost-plus leases, contracts for personal development services and contracts in respect of loan brokering, credit repair and contract breaking. Part IV deals with credit agreements, leases and prepaid purchase card contracts.  With respect to credit agreements, the Part sets out various rules including governing disclosure, representations, termination of optional services, limitations on credit agreement default charges and entitlements for a borrower to prepay a portion or all of their outstanding balance.  With respect to leases, the Part applies to leases for a fixed term of four months or more, leases for an indefinite term or that are renewed automatically until one of the parties takes positive steps to terminate them and residual obligation leases, but does not apply to purchase-cost-plus leases.  The Part sets out rules concerning representations, disclosure statements and the maximum liability of a lessee at the end of a residual obligation lease.  With respect to prepaid purchase card contracts, the Part provides that contracts and suppliers of contracts must comply with such requirements as may be prescribed.  The Part also prohibits suppliers from entering into prepaid purchase card contracts that have an expiry in respect of the performance of the contract.  A prepaid purchase card contract with an expiry is effective as if it has no expiry. Part V sets out various rules respecting consumer remedies, including when contracts are not binding or deemed to be void.  It also sets out rules regarding the assignment of consumer contracts, refunds of illegal charges and payments, the cancellation or reversal of credit card charges and rescission and cancellation rights.  The Part provides that consumers may terminate timeshare contracts on or after the 25-year anniversary of entering into the contract and the regulations may provide for rules in the event of the death of a consumer who is a party to a timeshare contract.  These rules apply to existing and future timeshare contracts.  When certain remedies are exercised, consumers and suppliers have obligations such as returning goods on request and giving refunds, respectively.  Certain rules are provided respecting non-compliance with credit agreements and leases.  The Part provides for procedures in respect of remedies. Part VI deals with the powers and duties of the Minister and Director, as well as inspectors and investigators.  The Part also provides for compliance and enforcement, including providing for the issuance of orders and administrative penalties and setting out offences and penalties under the Act.  This Part authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations with respect to various matters, including governing the form and content of consumer contracts, notices, invoices and other documents, the cashing of government cheques, rewards points, disclosure statements in respect of credit agreements and leases and repairs to motor vehicles.

An amendment is made to subsection 12. 4 (6) with respect to the timing for when a security freeze must be terminated. Subsections 12. 4 (7) and (8) are repealed.

New section 12. 6 permits a consumer to provide to a consumer reporting agency an explanatory statement about information in the consumer\u2019s file.  The agency must include the statement in every consumer report furnished by the agency if the report contains information pertaining to the statement, and the consumer may amend or remove the statement from the consumer\u2019s file.  If the consumer does not request that the statement be removed from their file, the agency must remove the statement on a specified date.

The Registrar or a designated person may also contact any person who manages a registrant\u2019s operations to exercise inspection powers without entering any premises.  The provision places limits and conditions on inspection powers as well as duties and obligations on registrants and other persons during inspections. New section 16. 3 provides that if the Registrar believes with reason that an activity for which registration is required is occurring, the Registrar or a designated person may conduct an inspection and that parts of section 16. 2 apply to those inspections.

Statutes of Ontario 2024, chapter 10  | Explanatory Note:  This Explanatory Note was written as a reader\u2019s aid to Bill 165 and does not form part of the law. Bill 165 has been enacted as Chapter 10 of the Statutes of Ontario, 2024. The Bill makes various amendments to the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998. A new section 28. 8 authorizes the Minister, subject to the Lieutenant Governor in Council\u2019s approval, to issue directives requiring the Ontario Energy Board (Board) to hold a generic hearing to determine any matter respecting natural gas or electricity over which it has jurisdiction that the directives specify. The directives may address various matters respecting the hearing, including setting out timelines and procedural requirements. A directive may apply with respect to a matter that is the subject of an ongoing proceeding before the Board, but may not apply with respect to a matter that was determined by a final order of the Board if fewer than two years have elapsed since the order was made. The section provides for the rules that apply if an ongoing proceeding is affected by a directive. A definition of \u201cgeneric hearing\u201d is added to section 3 of the Act, and section 19 of the Act is amended to specify that the Board has authority to hold generic hearings under subsection 19 (4). A new section 36. 0. 1 provides for the setting of a revenue horizon by regulations made under the Act. \u201cRevenue horizon\u201d is defined as the number of years of presumed revenue that is used in determining specified matters relating to the natural gas distribution system. The revenue horizon is used for the purposes of section 36 of the Act (respecting Board orders relating to the transmission, distribution and storage of gas). The new section also provides authority for regulations to be made that require the Board to hold a hearing to determine revenue horizons, and governing the hearings. A revenue horizon determined by the Board applies instead of one specified by the regulations. The Bill provides that section 36. 0. 1 is to be repealed on the earlier of January 1, 2029 and a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor. A new section 96. 2 authorizes the Minister, subject to the Lieutenant Governor in Council\u2019s approval, to issue directives providing that if a proposed natural gas transmission or dual-purpose transmission and distribution line specified by the directive is the subject of an application under section 90 of the Act for the Board\u2019s leave to construct the line, the Board is subject to certain requirements in making its determination, set out in subsection 96. 2 (1). A directive may apply with respect to an application that is already before the Board. The new section also provides authority for the Minister, subject to the Lieutenant Governor in Council\u2019s approval, to issue a directive respecting any order made by the Board between February 22, 2024 and December 31, 2024 in which the Board refuses to grant leave to construct a proposed natural gas transmission or dual-purpose transmission and distribution line, or grants it subject to specified conditions. Such a directive may require the Board to rescind the order and hold a new hearing, taking into account the requirements set out in subsection 96. 2 (1). For each of the new sections, the Bill provides that the exercise of powers under the sections are not subject to any duties of procedural fairness that would otherwise apply under the Statutory Powers Procedure Act or otherwise in law. In addition to adding the new sections, the Bill re-enacts sections 4. 4 and 4. 4. 1 of the Act, which require the Board to establish one or more processes for obtaining stakeholder input and providing for the representation of consumer and other interests, respectively. The re-enacted sections are expanded to apply to the gas context, as well as to provide authority for the making of regulations to specify or add to the list of persons whom the Board must contemplate in establishing processes. Related regulation-making powers are set out. Finally, the Bill amends section 95 of the Act. Currently, section 95 provides that the Board may make orders in special circumstances exempting persons from the leave to construct requirements in sections 90 and 92 of the Act. Section 95 is amended to additionally require the Board to make an order exempting persons from these requirements if the Board is satisfied that the circumstances prescribed by the regulations have been met. Related regulation-making powers are set out.", "bill-166": "bill-166 -- Bill 166 | Title: Strengthening Accountability and Student Supports Act, 2024 | Sponsor: Dunlop, Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate?, Mr. Terence Kernaghan: It\u2019s an honour for me to rise today as the MPP for London North Centre and add the voices of the great people of my riding., When we take a look at Bill 91, which we have up here for third reading, we see a number of different changes that this government is making. But what is concerning is that this government, in its ideological war against red tape, has done a lot of tinkering around the edges without addressing the actual needs of Ontarians right now. In fact, in many cases, they are ignoring as well as creating their own red tape\u2014or blue tape, as it were., This omnibus bill opens up so many laws across Ontario, and it does next to nothing to address the challenges that we face in terms of housing. It does nothing to stop the sprawl that we see, the carving up and the auctioning off of the greenbelt that this government is so fond of doing. We see the people are still going to continue to struggle with the ever-increasing cost of living. We see that people who are on social assistance are deliberately being relegated to below-poverty living standards and assistance levels. And we see that there is very little in terms of the investments that this government would claim in terms of rural communities for broadband infrastructure., The schedules that I\u2019m going to focus the majority of my comments on today will be schedules 7,14, 29, 30 and 33., First things first, I did want to briefly mention schedule 3, the Building Broadband Faster Act, which will permit the Minister of Infrastructure to make regulations governing the application. I want to also point out that the Financial Accountability Officer of Ontario in 2021-22 pointed out the vast amounts of money that this government chose not to invest in rural communities in terms of broadband infrastructure. | Bills: Bill 91, Bill 115, Bill 84, Bill 23, Bill 139, Bill 124, Bill 114, Bill 5, Bill 46, Bill 97, Bill 98, Bill 60, Bill 160, Bill 112", "tr-2024-06-05": "tr-2024-06-05 -- Transcript from: 2024-06-05 | Speakers: The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lorne Coe), Mr. Graham McGregor, Hon.

We are now just 72 hours away from a strike that would impact virtually every student across Ontario. For more than two months, we\u2019ve been negotiating with education unions with a very fair deal\u2014one that maintains a generous pension package and benefits. We came to the table looking to make a deal, with a significant increase of up to 10% over four years, because we know we have to keep kids in class., Right now our students need the stability of uninterrupted classroom learning. We cannot afford to put our young people through another roller-coaster of school closures and learning disruption. Right now our students need stability., For two years, our young people have carried the weight of this pandemic as their lives were put on hold. COVID interrupted all of our lives. It was a once-in-a-lifetime public health crisis that touched every aspect of our daily routine. People had to adjust to a new way of living during the pandemic, and that had real impacts, Speaker, on mental and physical health, and the financial well-being of our people. | Bills: Bill 128, Bill 115, Bill 124, Bill 23, Bill 28, Bill 132, Bill 29", "tr-2022-08-22": "tr-2022-08-22 -- Transcript from: 2022-08-22 | Speakers: Mr. Shamji moved first reading of the following bill, Hon.

Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Lieutenant Governor): Pray be seated., Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): May it please your Honour, the Legislative Assembly has elected me as their Speaker, though I am but little able to fulfill the important duties thus assigned to me. If, in the performance of those duties, I should at any time fall into error, I pray that the fault may be imputed to me and not to the assembly whose servant I am and who, through me, the better to enable them to discharge their duty to their Queen and country, hereby claim all their undoubted rights and privileges, especially that they may have freedom of speech in their debates, access to your person at all seasonable times, and that their proceedings may receive from you the most favourable consideration., Hon. Paul Calandra: Speaker, I am commanded by Her Honour the Lieutenant Governor to declare to you that she freely confides in the duty and attachment of the assembly to Her Majesty\u2019s person and government and, not doubting that the proceedings will be conducted with wisdom, temperance and prudence, she grants and upon all occasions will recognize and follow the constitutional privileges., I am commanded also to assure you that the assembly shall have ready access to Her Honour upon all suitable occasions and that their proceedings, as well as your words and actions, will constantly receive from her the most favourable construction., Her Honour the Lieutenant Governor was pleased to open the session by reading the speech from the throne., Speech from the throne / Discours du tr\u00f4ne, Hon. Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Lieutenant Governor): Speaker of the House, honourable members, ladies and gentlemen, people of Ontario:\nHonorables d\u00e9put\u00e9s, Ontariennes et Ontariens., I want to start by acknowledging that we are on lands traditionally occupied by Indigenous peoples. They continue to care for this land, they continue to shape Ontario today\u2014and I want to show my respect., Traditionally, Toronto has been a gathering place for many Indigenous nations including the Anishinabeg, the Haudenosaunee, the Wendat and M\u00e9tis peoples. I acknowledge we are meeting in the area covered by Treaty 13, also known as the Toronto Purchase, and I pay my respects to the Mississaugas of the Credit., As the representative of Her Majesty the Queen, it is my privilege to open the first session of the 43rd Parliament by delivering the speech from the throne., And I wish to congratulate the members present today, both new and returning. You have been entrusted by the people of Ontario to ably and thoughtfully represent their interests., This is a responsibility none should take lightly. The decisions made at Queen\u2019s Park, the people\u2019s Legislature, are far-reaching. They touch every person in every part of the province., As members you will disagree, sometimes if not often passionately and with conviction. That is the nature of a healthy democracy., However, with the province, country and world having been through so much, and as we now face new and looming challenges, now is not the time for partisanship and ideology to trump the virtues of partnership and collaboration. The people of Ontario rightly expect their government to work with others in common cause and in service of delivering real solutions., They can have confidence that their government will do just that. Because now is the time for unity., A unity of people. A unity of purpose., Unit\u00e9 du peuple. Unit\u00e9 des objectifs., Here in Ontario, across Canada and around the world, we are witnessing a growing sense of uncertainty with no historical precedent for the unique circumstances facing the global economy., New variants of COVID-19 are having an uneven impact on different regions of the world, with some countries implementing economically disruptive measures once again., Inflation has hit levels not seen in almost four decades, with no broad consensus on the speed with which it will return to normal levels., Global supply chains first disrupted by the pandemic remain stressed, further exacerbated by Russia\u2019s unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine., With nearly 370,000 jobs currently unfilled, Ontario is facing a generational labour shortage with the lowest rate of unemployment since 1989., And unprecedented spending throughout the pandemic has created new fiscal challenges here in Ontario and across Canada that will require prudent economic management in the months and years to come., It is sometimes easy to consider these challenges in the abstract, but they have real and significant consequences on the lives of hard-working people and businesses., People are now paying more for everyday goods like groceries and gas, putting increased strain on household budgets, particularly for low-income families. Long-planned vacations are being put on hold as small family pleasures like a meal out at a favourite local restaurant become just a little out of reach., Businesses of all sizes are struggling to find the skilled women and men they need to grow, or the parts they need to take on more orders. Amidst this scarcity, the rising cost of labour and supplies may in turn increase the cost of goods being sold to consumers., Taken together, these looming fiscal and economic challenges cannot be understated or ignored. They must be confronted head-on., And there are no easy solutions., In response to growing inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada has started to increase its policy interest rate. While the full impact of this response is currently unclear, Ontario, like the rest of Canada and North America, must be prepared for the possibility of a near-term economic slowdown., Even as the province, country and world navigate a period of uncertainty, your government can be sure of the fundamentals of a strong, vibrant and successful province and economy., Low taxes and a competitive business environment that attracts investments and creates good jobs., A highly skilled workforce prepared for the jobs of today and tomorrow., Roads, highways and other critical infrastructure that help get goods and services to market sooner., Livable and safe communities with good schools and high-quality hospitals and long-term-care homes, as well as convenient transit options., Over the past four years, Ontario has come so far., The province\u2019s automotive and manufacturing sectors are breathing new life. Shovels are in the ground on transformational transit and transportation projects. More women and men are entering rewarding careers in the skilled trades., Now is the time to redouble these efforts. | Bills: Bill 1, Bill 2", "tr-2023-10-16": "tr-2023-10-16 -- Transcript from: 2023-10-16 | Speakers: Hon.

Since we were here last evening, perhaps a bit of a recap: Last night, we were talking a lot about some of the changes in the bill with respect to the voting processes in some of our municipal councils with respect to the provincial policy statement. We heard a lot from colleagues opposite that somehow this would be a very undemocratic process, that the process the government was bringing in hadn\u2019t been used before, that it would change democracy forever, it would crash the Western hemisphere, it would kill Westminster parliamentary traditions and revert us back to prior to the Magna Carta and the world would fall apart. | Bills: Bill 23, Bill 124, Bill 26, Bill 55, Bill 57, Bill 7, Bill 125, Bill 39, Bill 5, Bill 59, Bill 3, Bill 56, Bill 218, Bill 29, Bill 54, Bill 51, Bill 31, Bill 36, Bill 43", "tr-2023-05-29": "tr-2023-05-29 -- Transcript from: 2023-05-29 | Speakers: Hon.

We are being proactive, purposeful and precise, taking clear action so we can target crime and keep our communities safe. This is why we\u2019re taking firm action to improve safety by introducing this legislation that, if passed, would transform policing and community safety by, Ms. Peggy Sattler, Ms. Jess Dixon, Ms. Laura Smith, Hon.

Paul Calandra, Mr. Ross Romano, Mr. Jeff Burch, Mr. John Vanthof, The costs keep getting racked up, so the question we need to have answered in this House is, how many more consultants like Mr. Guest are going to get rich while Crosstown costs go through the roof? How many more deficient projects are they going to build? And more importantly, Speaker, will this government today, as it did when we demanded it from Ottawa, declare a public inquiry into this mess? Simple answer to the question, Mr. Lorne Coe, Hon.

I understand that the government is trying to work fast, to try to get ahead of something that\u2019s affecting all of us. Does it go far enough? We\u2019ll be exploring it within this debate., Identity theft, fraud and cyber attacks are serious problems that can have devastating impacts on individuals. We all know this. Ontarians need to be able to trust that their personal information and data is safe and their privacy is protected in our public and private institutions. When someone steals your personal information, like your name, social security number or banking information, they can pretend to be you. In 2021, Canadians lost over $230 million to online fraud, including identity theft, that we know of. The complexity involved with trying to recover from identity theft takes loads of time and money and, of course, incredible stress., When a cyber attack happens to an organization, they can not only steal massive amounts of personal data; they can shut down critical operations. When hackers hold this data hostage in a ransomware attack, it\u2019s been reported that the cost of Canadian companies averages about $1.9 million per incident., Artificial intelligence: Who knows how much it will evolve? We know in our attempts to make life easier and for us to continue to increasingly rely on technology, we\u2019re solving a lot of problems, but we\u2019re also creating others. It\u2019s hard to keep up. Once we have opened Pandora\u2019s box and it\u2019s open, once you commit to certain acts or train an AI or do whatever it is, you can\u2019t step it back. At some point, we all know that this AI is going to overtake us in many different ways, so it\u2019s important to have a handle on that. Again, it\u2019s important for us to be discussing this here in our Legislature, and I\u2019m hoping these conversations are happening across the world., First off, I\u2019m going to be relying on information provided by different individuals, namely an expert in the field named John Wunderlich. I appreciate the research and comments on the bill he has provided. As well, I would like to thank the Law Commission of Ontario, who have made a detailed submission to the government on Bill 194. In the submission, they made 11 concrete recommendations that the government could implement to improve this legislation, and I hope that the government will take their recommendations very seriously., We also heard from one of the members opposite that this seems to be legislation in flux and movement, so again, I really hope that they will be listening to the experts as we see this move forward and that the regulations that will finally come will be in consultation with those that have our best interests at heart., Like many government bills, this here is largely a regulatory framework. Notwithstanding what was said earlier, we see this has been a pattern in a lot of government regulation. We don\u2019t know exactly what all the regulations are going to be or if they will be enough to deal with the challenges of cyber security or emerging AI. There\u2019s also, again, no regulation on the private sector, which is just as susceptible to data breaches., So when you look at schedule 1, it\u2019s about enhancing digital trust in the public sector and what safe cyber security measures public agencies will have to follow to protect the data that\u2019s in their hands. The problem is that smaller municipalities have said they don\u2019t have the finances and capacity to manage this on their own. What are the assurances being made to Ontarians that measures will be in place to ensure that our data is safe with third-party and, perhaps, foreign corporations that will actually be handling the data?, Why do I say this? It\u2019s very easy for governments, and especially this government, to increasingly privatize as well as download. So what we\u2019re seeing here is the government essentially telling municipalities, \u201cHey, look, this is important, but ultimately figure it out yourself.\u201d There\u2019s no money attached to it. There\u2019s no real plan to help them with that. So while we may all agree this is a very, very important issue, I think more leadership is needed in this area, and something a little more prescriptive, and I\u2019ll be getting to that a little later., Our libraries, schools and hospitals need support with resources, training and building capacity for better cyber security\u2014again, not just slapping them with extra responsibility without any leadership or means of implementing these changes that they\u2019re sort of alluding to. We have seen this before. We all know how it can end. The government is, again, downloading these responsibilities without funding. They love to tell municipalities what to do. I mean, we have seen that in a lot of legislation, but I\u2019m not going to talk about that today., Schedule 2 makes changes to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act applies to the provincial government, universities, colleges, hospitals and designated entities. These changes would expand the reporting requirements when there has been a data breach and make our institutions undertake proactive measures to avoid thefts, losses and other unauthorized uses of personal information., 1710, While the schedule sets a few standards, none of the sections propose substantive information. Essentially, what it says is, \u201cTrust us. We will make those rules and regulations.\u201d As I\u2019ve mentioned before, when you listen to some of the government members, it\u2019s almost as if cyber security will cease to exist if this passes into law. Let\u2019s not over-promise here, right?, The protections around those under 18, of course, are important, but also very vague. So we want to hear the real content on how they will be protecting the digital information of people under 18., Schedule 2 does add in whistle-blower protections\u2014which is good\u2014if someone believes there is a contravention or there will be an apparent contravention of the act. The complainant can request confidentiality and the Information and Privacy Commissioner would not be able to reveal the identity of the complainant. Of course, we want to protect our whistle-blowers, who are often putting themselves at risk to protect all of us. Again, that\u2019s something that\u2019s good. It would also allow the Information and Privacy Commissioner to consult with other privacy commissioners and enter into agreements with them to coordinate and publish guidelines. That\u2019s good, too., Canada has become a target for cyber and ransomware attacks. We always have, but we continue to see increasing attacks here. Approximately 9% of Ontario municipalities have experienced a significant cyber breach in just the past two years alone. In Canada, and particularly Ontario, there have been several notable cyber security incidents that highlight vulnerabilities at various levels of governance and private organizations. One significant case involved the Better Outcomes Registry and Network, otherwise known as BORN Ontario. In May 2023, a cyber attack exposed the personal health information of 3.4 million people, including details relating to pregnancy care and newborns. The breach underscored the need for more robust data protection measures, as the compromised data included sensitive information such as names, addresses and health card numbers., When the Toronto Public Library was attacked last year, and more recently the Hamilton Public Library, people\u2019s lives were put on hold. With no means to use a public computer or Internet at their local branch, many were left without a way to search for a job or housing. I know I was at the library following this attack and saw what it did to the system. Others were left disconnected from staying connected to friends and families abroad, or had their studies significantly curtailed by the outages., When the city of Hamilton was attacked, it was so paralyzing. Imagine that firefighters were using Google Maps to respond to calls for help. So they have major, major damage, you find, when you have a cyber attack. In the case, of course, of our first responders, it could be life-and-death results. It also, of course, had financial impacts. The city of Hamilton\u2019s staff were unable to process approximately $36 million in preauthorized property tax payments, among other things. Furthermore, when the Toronto Public Library was attacked, it\u2019s believed to have exposed the data of their own employees going back to 1998., The preamble of the bill states that Ontario recognizes the value of enhancing Ontario\u2019s privacy safeguards through increased transparency and independent oversight. If this were true, it would include privacy and protection for employees both in the public and private sectors, which cannot be legislated federally except for employees under the federal labour code. In fact, employees in Ontario are the least likely to have privacy protection at work compared to other provinces and territories., Again, we see a lot of good things in the legislation but the government really needs not to just look at the public side, but the private side. As I\u2019ve said earlier, a lot of our data is there and we need to protect literally everyone., Vaping detectors: Again, schools in Brampton and Mississauga installed vape detectors in student washrooms. Privacy concerns arose as a result of this when it was discovered that these devices were actually capable of detecting audio-capturing capabilities of the devices in a private space. The vape detectors came after the province announced a three-year $30-million fund to allow school boards to purchase the detectors., This is an example of how a privacy impact assessment is important prior to using technology with data-capturing technology. Of course, you would expect that parents would have wanted to know exactly what this was in advance and, as you can imagine, there were concerns that were raised., The importance of funding public institutions: Speaker, this legislation puts all the responsibility on public entities to develop in-house AI and other measures. But we know our schools are so starved by this government that they can\u2019t even meet the basic needs, in many cases, of our students. How can we possibly expect and require them to do this without lots and lots of outsourcing to, of course, private companies? We have not been talking about private companies in this legislation., So what are we doing? We\u2019re setting up schools and municipalities to open the door to foreign companies to have access to private data, including our children\u2019s data. Data that is out there cannot be retracted. Data that is stolen can\u2019t be recovered. Without proper funding, contracts will be given out, once again, to private hands from our public coffers. So, again, why no assurances and protections with regard to privately held data?, It seems odd that we\u2019re saying our public institutions must adhere to these standards, but we know they can\u2019t and will have to rely on private companies that aren\u2019t being included here. We know the public institutions are so cash-strapped they won\u2019t be able to develop their own cyber security systems and, of course, will be relying on third parties., I\u2019m going to read some excerpts from privacy expert and data protection expert John Wunderlich, who, again, we thank for weighing in on this matter. Here\u2019s a quote from him:\n\u201cBill 194 has been introduced in the current context of the ongoing evolution of cyber security and privacy threats and the explosive growth of artificial intelligence., \u201cIt is worth noting that the bill does not make amendments to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy-MFIPPA (the sister act to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act-FIPPA). Hopefully, this can be addressed as the bill goes through the legislative process.\u201d And of course, you know they\u2019ve left a lot of this to regulation, so this is something they should be looking at., \u201cIt must be said that if one of the government\u2019s objectives in the bill were to improve cyber security and privacy protections for Ontarians, this would have been a golden opportunity to introduce private sector legislation to provide a made-in-Ontario solution that could supplement and extend the protections offered by federal legislation and ensure that Ontarians have robust and equivalent protection in both the public and private sectors. In particular, the government of Ontario\u2019s failure to protect employees\u2019 privacy is a long-standing issue highlighted by the gaps in this legislation., \u201cEmployees in Ontario do not have legislation that protects their privacy in either the public or the\u201d private \u201csector. Public sector privacy protections were removed in 1995, making Ontario unique among Canadian provinces in that it does not protect the privacy of civil servants at work. It is also the case that, due to employment being in provincial jurisdiction, federal private sector privacy legislation does not protect employees in Ontario.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we are doing things here in Ontario, since we can\u2019t rely fully on the federal legislation., \u201cThe bill has two significant elements. Schedule 1, \u2018Enhancing Digital Security and Trust Act,\u2019 addresses cyber security issues, the use of artificial intelligence systems, the impact of digital technology on children, and some general provisions, all of which will be addressed below., \u201cSchedule 2, \u2018Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,\u201d amends the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,\u201d 1990., Here\u2019s a bit of a comparison of how non-prescriptive this is, as compared to similar legislation happening elsewhere:\n\u201cBill 194 is 51 pages long. From a content perspective, that is about 17 pages in English, with a matching section in French. If you think, \u2018This seems a bit perfunctory, given the complicated nature of cyber security, digital protection of children, and privacy,\u2019 you would be right. It seems to me that the entire bill could be summarized by saying that the government recognizes the importance of issues and will, therefore, write and implement regulations sometime in the future to deal with them. \u2018Just trust us and pass the bill.\u2019, \u201cWhen you compare this to the four years of discussion that went into creating the 458-page EU Artificial Intelligence Act, it comes up short, literally and figuratively., \u201cCloser to home\u201d\u2014don\u2019t look at Europe; just look at what\u2019s going on federally. I think that they\u2019re essentially allowing the feds to eat their lunch here. But what did John say? He said, \u201cCloser to home, Bill C-27, which includes the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, is 148 pages (or 74 pages in English) but is accompanied by more than 100 civil society, industry, and expert submissions on the provisions and issues of the bill., \u201cCyber security, \u201cThis part of Bill 194 boils down to a requirement for the government to make regulations governing cyber security. | Bills: Bill 201, Bill 124, Bill 194, Bill 213, Bill 173", "tr-2024-03-21": "tr-2024-03-21 -- Transcript from: 2024-03-21 | Speakers: Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate? I recognize the member for Nickel Belt., M\nme\n France G\u00e9linas: Thank you, Speaker. If you\u2019ll allow me, I would like to say thank you. I was supposed to do my lead on Thursday afternoon. I would like to thank my House leader team, as well as the House leader from the government, for allowing me to postpone my lead to this morning. I attended my nephew\u2019s funeral Thursday afternoon. I was there when my nephew was born. My daughter used to babysit him and his brother. I was there when he graduated. He was a gifted mechanic, a really nice person. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 28, and it was gut-wrenching. I thank you for allowing me time to grieve with my family and attend his funeral. I will change the topic because I may start crying., Thank you, also, to everybody who reached out and offered me a word of encouragement and support. From both sides of the House, I received them, and it was very much appreciated. Thank you., Applause., M\nme\n France G\u00e9linas: To Bill 135: Bill 135 is a bill that will change how home care is managed and coordinated in Ontario. Our health care system has many parts: health promotion, disease prevention\u2014most people know about primary care, where you have a physician or a nurse practitioner who follows you. We know our hospital system, whether it be specialty care, pediatric care\u2014we have strong hospitals. We have palliative care. We have community mental health and addictions. We also have a part of this big system of care that is called home care., Home care has seen many changes in the way that it is governed and managed but not so many in the way that it is delivered. The way that it is managed is that there are basically three big groups of people who have needs and can live healthy and productive lives with the help of home care. We will start with the small one., Some people are born with severe disability or diseases right from birth, whether they need special G-tube feeding to be able to feed themselves or they need help with breathing. Often, those babies becoming kids becoming grown-ups will be sent home with home care. For a lot of people who have severe disability and health needs\u2014as I said, for breathing, for eating etc.\u2014they could be on home care for their entire life. If you have a disability, you may tap into what is called the Passport Program, where you will basically become an employer and hire your own people to come and provide home care to you. Home care can range from helping you get out of bed and into your wheelchair in the morning, transferring to a toilet, showering, preparing meals, eating\u2014all of the activities of daily living. So that\u2019s one part., The second part, which most adults will know, is post-discharge from hospitals\u2014the ones that are the best known are hip and knee surgeries. I will take them as an example, but there are many others. For hip and knee surgeries, in my day, you used to be admitted to a hospital two or three days before and have the surgery. For a knee, you stayed for a week; for a hip, you stayed at least for 10 days\u2014none of that anymore. All of the assessment is done ahead of time. They show you the exercises that you\u2019ll have to do. They fit you for a walker or crutches, or whatever needs to be done. All of this is done before surgery. More and more, the surgery will be done the same day. The day of the surgery, you will be able to go home\u2014or, at least, the next day or the following day. But the follow-up that used to happen in the hospital still needs to happen. You will have big surgical scars for which you will need a change of bandages. You will still need to be seen by a physiotherapist to make sure that you get your range of motion, you get your balance, you have full extension in your knees, you learn how to go up and down the stairs and how to manage on uneven ground\u2014all of this. More and more of this in our home care is what we call bundled care; that is, you go home and you have a bundle of care where you already know that the nurse will come to see you on this day, this day and this day to change the bandages. The physiotherapist will come to see you to teach you exercises, then on day 5, she\u2019ll start to teach you range of motion so that you get ready for stairs etc. etc. Bundled care happens after surgical or in-patient admission into the hospital. | Bills: Bill 90, Bill 124, Bill 23, Bill 154, Bill 93, Bill 180, Bill 135, Bill 8, Bill 153, Bill 146, Bill 155, Bill 156", "tr-2022-08-31": "tr-2022-08-31 -- Transcript from: 2022-08-31 | Speakers: Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate?, M\n. Guy Bourgouin: C\u2019est toujours un plaisir de me lever pour parler du projet de loi 149. Surtout, quand on parle de travailleurs ou de projets de loi qui adressent ou qui disent\u2014je devrais bien mettre le\u2014il faut le dire tr\u00e8s fort, l\u00e0 : qui disent qu\u2019ils travaillent pour les travailleurs. Mais qu\u2019est-ce qui arrive? Ce que le monde ne sait pas, c\u2019est que le gouvernement, souvent\u2014nous, on propose beaucoup de propositions et beaucoup de projets de loi pour am\u00e9liorer les conditions des travailleurs. On entend souvent le gouvernement dire que l\u2019opposition officielle vote toujours contre des projets de loi, vote toujours contre des projets de loi. Mais je peux vous dire : le sentiment est mutuel quand \u00e7a vient \u00e0 l\u2019opposition officielle et qu\u2019on se fait dire non \u00e0 des propositions qu\u2019on fait pour am\u00e9liorer des projets de loi et pour aider les travailleurs., Parce que, vous le savez et tout le monde sait, le NPD, c\u2019est un parti qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 par les travailleurs. On va tout le temps \u00eatre l\u00e0 pour travailler et pour les supporter, les travailleurs, sans exception. Dans les faits, non seulement le NPD a mis plus de l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019avant pour prot\u00e9ger et am\u00e9liorer les conditions des travailleurs, mais en plus\u2014comme j\u2019ai dit\u2014les conservateurs votent souvent contre., Pour donner un exemple, on a mis souvent la proposition anti-scab dans la l\u00e9gislature pour des projets de loi pour prot\u00e9ger\u2014puis on le sait; c\u2019est d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Il y a bien des pays et il y a bien des places qui l\u2019ont, l\u2019anti-scab. \u00c7a aide. Moi, je le sais; j\u2019ai n\u00e9goci\u00e9 pendant 22 ans pour les m\u00e9tallos. Je travaillais avec les employeurs, et je le disais souvent : n\u2019importe quel imb\u00e9cile\u2014si je peux user du terme en Chambre\u2014peut n\u00e9gocier une gr\u00e8ve; n\u2019importe lequel. Ce n\u2019est pas plus compliqu\u00e9 que \u00e7a, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident : tu dis non \u00e0 toutes les propositions. Mais, moi, quand j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 dans le domaine, je me souviens, c\u2019\u00e9tait Normand Rivard, qui \u00e9tait un de mes mentors, qui me dit : \u00ab Guy, le bon n\u00e9gociateur, ce qu\u2019il va faire, lui : il va trouver des solutions. \u00bb C\u2019est facile de dire non. N\u2019importe quel imb\u00e9cile\u2014comme j\u2019ai dit\u2014peut dire \u00e7a., Mais je peux vous dire que, des fois, m\u00eame si on trouve toutes les solutions, veux, veux pas, les deux parties \nne sont pas capables de s\u2019entendre. Mais on sait que c\u2019est rare que \u00e7a arrive\u2014tu sais, la gr\u00e8ve. On parle de gr\u00e8ve, on parle de gr\u00e8ve\u2014mais \u00e7a n\u2019arrive pas tr\u00e8s souvent. Les conventions se font sans gr\u00e8ve. Pourquoi? C\u2019est un petit pourcentage, parce que 95 % des conventions se r\u00e8glent\u201495 % ou 97 %? | Bills: Bill 21, Bill 90, Bill 124, Bill 23, Bill 135, Bill 149, Bill 153, Bill 151, Bill 76, Bill 131, Bill 146, Bill 2", "tr-2023-11-01": "tr-2023-11-01 -- Transcript from: 2023-11-01 | Speakers: Ms. Stephanie Bowman, Mr. Sheref Sabawy, Mr. Adil Shamji, Mr. Ric Bresee, Hon.

Ted Arnott): Would the minister care to lead off the debate?, Hon. Steve Clark: I would love to, Speaker. It\u2019s a real pleasure and a privilege to rise for second reading of our government\u2019s proposed Better Municipal Governance Act, 2022. At the outset of our government\u2019s leadoff, I want to indicate to you that I\u2019m going to be sharing my time with two great parliamentarians: the Associate Minister of Housing, the Honourable Michael Parsa; and the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, MPP Kevin Holland. Both the associate minister and the parliamentary assistant will be touching on some specific items in the proposed legislation. Speaker, it\u2019s great to see you in the chair, and I want to welcome all the members to debate for this very, very important bill for our government., Speaker, I want to take you back to June. Our government was re-elected with a very strong mandate to help more Ontarians find a home that meets their needs and their budget. Our ministry, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, continues to play an essential role in fulfilling the mandate, under the leadership of Premier Ford, who has made it crystal clear from day one that this issue is an important priority for our government., Let\u2019s talk about the housing crisis. Ontario is a prosperous and growing province\u2014I think we can all agree that it\u2019s the best place in Canada to live and to call home\u2014but increased demand for new homes and a lack of supply have been driving prices out of reach for too many Ontarians who are struggling to find the right home. This is true for younger people eager to start a family in the community of their choosing; for newcomers who are ready to put down roots and begin a new life here in this great province of Ontario; and for seniors who are looking to downsize but wanting to stay near their family, their community and their loved ones. This is not just a big-city crisis. The housing supply shortage affects all Ontarians, whether you live in a rural or urban or suburban community, whether you live in the north or the south, whether you\u2019re young or old. Our government knows that we need to tackle this problem, and we know what must be done. We have to get this under control. That\u2019s why we remain laser-focused on policies that get more homes built faster. | Bills: Bill 4, Bill 31, Bill 23, Bill 124, Bill 39, Bill 28, Bill 218, Bill 5, Bill 36, Bill 108, Bill 26, Bill 3, Bill 14, Bill 24, Bill 42, Bill 109, Bill 15", "tr-2024-11-06": "tr-2024-11-06 -- Transcript from: 2024-11-06 | Speakers: Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate?, Mr. Terence Kernaghan: It\u2019s an honour for me to rise today as the MPP for London North Centre and add the voices of the great people of my riding., When we take a look at Bill 91, which we have up here for third reading, we see a number of different changes that this government is making. But what is concerning is that this government, in its ideological war against red tape, has done a lot of tinkering around the edges without addressing the actual needs of Ontarians right now. In fact, in many cases, they are ignoring as well as creating their own red tape\u2014or blue tape, as it were., This omnibus bill opens up so many laws across Ontario, and it does next to nothing to address the challenges that we face in terms of housing. It does nothing to stop the sprawl that we see, the carving up and the auctioning off of the greenbelt that this government is so fond of doing. We see the people are still going to continue to struggle with the ever-increasing cost of living. We see that people who are on social assistance are deliberately being relegated to below-poverty living standards and assistance levels. And we see that there is very little in terms of the investments that this government would claim in terms of rural communities for broadband infrastructure., The schedules that I\u2019m going to focus the majority of my comments on today will be schedules 7,14, 29, 30 and 33., First things first, I did want to briefly mention schedule 3, the Building Broadband Faster Act, which will permit the Minister of Infrastructure to make regulations governing the application. I want to also point out that the Financial Accountability Officer of Ontario in 2021-22 pointed out the vast amounts of money that this government chose not to invest in rural communities in terms of broadband infrastructure. | Bills: Bill 46, Bill 139, Bill 60, Bill 98, Bill 84, Bill 114, Bill 5, Bill 115, Bill 97, Bill 124, Bill 23, Bill 112, Bill 91, Bill 160"}, "transcript 2024-04-09": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2024-04-09", "summary": "Transcript from: 2024-04-09 | Speakers: Mr. Jeff Burch, Mr. Billy Pang, Ms. Aislinn Clancy, Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate?, M\n. Guy Bourgouin: C\u2019est toujours un plaisir de me lever pour parler du projet de loi 149. Surtout, quand on parle de travailleurs ou de projets de loi qui adressent ou qui disent\u2014je devrais bien mettre le\u2014il faut le dire tr\u00e8s fort, l\u00e0 : qui disent qu\u2019ils travaillent pour les travailleurs. Mais qu\u2019est-ce qui arrive? Ce que le monde ne sait pas, c\u2019est que le gouvernement, souvent\u2014nous, on propose beaucoup de propositions et beaucoup de projets de loi pour am\u00e9liorer les conditions des travailleurs. On entend souvent le gouvernement dire que l\u2019opposition officielle vote toujours contre des projets de loi, vote toujours contre des projets de loi. Mais je peux vous dire : le sentiment est mutuel quand \u00e7a vient \u00e0 l\u2019opposition officielle et qu\u2019on se fait dire non \u00e0 des propositions qu\u2019on fait pour am\u00e9liorer des projets de loi et pour aider les travailleurs., Parce que, vous le savez et tout le monde sait, le NPD, c\u2019est un parti qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 par les travailleurs. On va tout le temps \u00eatre l\u00e0 pour travailler et pour les supporter, les travailleurs, sans exception. Dans les faits, non seulement le NPD a mis plus de l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019avant pour prot\u00e9ger et am\u00e9liorer les conditions des travailleurs, mais en plus\u2014comme j\u2019ai dit\u2014les conservateurs votent souvent contre., Pour donner un exemple, on a mis souvent la proposition anti-scab dans la l\u00e9gislature pour des projets de loi pour prot\u00e9ger\u2014puis on le sait; c\u2019est d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Il y a bien des pays et il y a bien des places qui l\u2019ont, l\u2019anti-scab. \u00c7a aide. Moi, je le sais; j\u2019ai n\u00e9goci\u00e9 pendant 22 ans pour les m\u00e9tallos. Je travaillais avec les employeurs, et je le disais souvent : n\u2019importe quel imb\u00e9cile\u2014si je peux user du terme en Chambre\u2014peut n\u00e9gocier une gr\u00e8ve; n\u2019importe lequel. Ce n\u2019est pas plus compliqu\u00e9 que \u00e7a, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident : tu dis non \u00e0 toutes les propositions. Mais, moi, quand j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 dans le domaine, je me souviens, c\u2019\u00e9tait Normand Rivard, qui \u00e9tait un de mes mentors, qui me dit : \u00ab Guy, le bon n\u00e9gociateur, ce qu\u2019il va faire, lui : il va trouver des solutions. \u00bb C\u2019est facile de dire non. N\u2019importe quel imb\u00e9cile\u2014comme j\u2019ai dit\u2014peut dire \u00e7a., Mais je peux vous dire que, des fois, m\u00eame si on trouve toutes les solutions, veux, veux pas, les deux parties \nne sont pas capables de s\u2019entendre. Mais on sait que c\u2019est rare que \u00e7a arrive\u2014tu sais, la gr\u00e8ve. On parle de gr\u00e8ve, on parle de gr\u00e8ve\u2014mais \u00e7a n\u2019arrive pas tr\u00e8s souvent.

Stephen Lecce: I introduce Bill 28, the Keeping Students in Class Act, which would provide stability and certainty in our schools. We are now just 72 hours away from a strike that would impact virtually every student across Ontario. For more than two months, we\u2019ve been negotiating with education unions with a very fair deal\u2014one that maintains a generous pension package and benefits. We came to the table looking to make a deal, with a significant increase of up to 10% over four years, because we know we have to keep kids in class., Right now our students need the stability of uninterrupted classroom learning. We cannot afford to put our young people through another roller-coaster of school closures and learning disruption. Right now our students need stability., For two years, our young people have carried the weight of this pandemic as their lives were put on hold. COVID interrupted all of our lives. It was a once-in-a-lifetime public health crisis that touched every aspect of our daily routine. People had to adjust to a new way of living during the pandemic, and that had real impacts, Speaker, on mental and physical health, and the financial well-being of our people. | Bills: Bill 128, Bill 115, Bill 28, Bill 29, Bill 124, Bill 132, Bill 23"}, "transcript 2022-11-17": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2022-11-17", "summary": "Transcript from: 2022-11-17 | Speakers: Mr. Jeff Burch, Hon.

Ted Arnott): Would the minister care to lead off the debate?, Hon. Steve Clark: I would love to, Speaker. It\u2019s a real pleasure and a privilege to rise for second reading of our government\u2019s proposed Better Municipal Governance Act, 2022. At the outset of our government\u2019s leadoff, I want to indicate to you that I\u2019m going to be sharing my time with two great parliamentarians: the Associate Minister of Housing, the Honourable Michael Parsa; and the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, MPP Kevin Holland. Both the associate minister and the parliamentary assistant will be touching on some specific items in the proposed legislation. Speaker, it\u2019s great to see you in the chair, and I want to welcome all the members to debate for this very, very important bill for our government., Speaker, I want to take you back to June. Our government was re-elected with a very strong mandate to help more Ontarians find a home that meets their needs and their budget. Our ministry, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, continues to play an essential role in fulfilling the mandate, under the leadership of Premier Ford, who has made it crystal clear from day one that this issue is an important priority for our government., Let\u2019s talk about the housing crisis. Ontario is a prosperous and growing province\u2014I think we can all agree that it\u2019s the best place in Canada to live and to call home\u2014but increased demand for new homes and a lack of supply have been driving prices out of reach for too many Ontarians who are struggling to find the right home. This is true for younger people eager to start a family in the community of their choosing; for newcomers who are ready to put down roots and begin a new life here in this great province of Ontario; and for seniors who are looking to downsize but wanting to stay near their family, their community and their loved ones. This is not just a big-city crisis. The housing supply shortage affects all Ontarians, whether you live in a rural or urban or suburban community, whether you live in the north or the south, whether you\u2019re young or old. Our government knows that we need to tackle this problem, and we know what must be done. We have to get this under control. That\u2019s why we remain laser-focused on policies that get more homes built faster. | Bills: Bill 42, Bill 108, Bill 4, Bill 3, Bill 26, Bill 36, Bill 5, Bill 218, Bill 28, Bill 15, Bill 124, Bill 14, Bill 109, Bill 23, Bill 39, Bill 24, Bill 31"}, "transcript 2022-08-25": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2022-08-25", "summary": "Transcript from: 2022-08-25 | Speakers: Hon.

Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Lieutenant Governor): Pray be seated., Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): May it please your Honour, the Legislative Assembly has elected me as their Speaker, though I am but little able to fulfill the important duties thus assigned to me. If, in the performance of those duties, I should at any time fall into error, I pray that the fault may be imputed to me and not to the assembly whose servant I am and who, through me, the better to enable them to discharge their duty to their Queen and country, hereby claim all their undoubted rights and privileges, especially that they may have freedom of speech in their debates, access to your person at all seasonable times, and that their proceedings may receive from you the most favourable consideration., Hon. Paul Calandra: Speaker, I am commanded by Her Honour the Lieutenant Governor to declare to you that she freely confides in the duty and attachment of the assembly to Her Majesty\u2019s person and government and, not doubting that the proceedings will be conducted with wisdom, temperance and prudence, she grants and upon all occasions will recognize and follow the constitutional privileges., I am commanded also to assure you that the assembly shall have ready access to Her Honour upon all suitable occasions and that their proceedings, as well as your words and actions, will constantly receive from her the most favourable construction., Her Honour the Lieutenant Governor was pleased to open the session by reading the speech from the throne., Speech from the throne / Discours du tr\u00f4ne, Hon. Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Lieutenant Governor): Speaker of the House, honourable members, ladies and gentlemen, people of Ontario:\nHonorables d\u00e9put\u00e9s, Ontariennes et Ontariens., I want to start by acknowledging that we are on lands traditionally occupied by Indigenous peoples. They continue to care for this land, they continue to shape Ontario today\u2014and I want to show my respect., Traditionally, Toronto has been a gathering place for many Indigenous nations including the Anishinabeg, the Haudenosaunee, the Wendat and M\u00e9tis peoples. I acknowledge we are meeting in the area covered by Treaty 13, also known as the Toronto Purchase, and I pay my respects to the Mississaugas of the Credit., As the representative of Her Majesty the Queen, it is my privilege to open the first session of the 43rd Parliament by delivering the speech from the throne., And I wish to congratulate the members present today, both new and returning. You have been entrusted by the people of Ontario to ably and thoughtfully represent their interests., This is a responsibility none should take lightly. The decisions made at Queen\u2019s Park, the people\u2019s Legislature, are far-reaching. They touch every person in every part of the province., As members you will disagree, sometimes if not often passionately and with conviction. That is the nature of a healthy democracy., However, with the province, country and world having been through so much, and as we now face new and looming challenges, now is not the time for partisanship and ideology to trump the virtues of partnership and collaboration. The people of Ontario rightly expect their government to work with others in common cause and in service of delivering real solutions., They can have confidence that their government will do just that. Because now is the time for unity., A unity of people. A unity of purpose., Unit\u00e9 du peuple. Unit\u00e9 des objectifs., Here in Ontario, across Canada and around the world, we are witnessing a growing sense of uncertainty with no historical precedent for the unique circumstances facing the global economy., New variants of COVID-19 are having an uneven impact on different regions of the world, with some countries implementing economically disruptive measures once again., Inflation has hit levels not seen in almost four decades, with no broad consensus on the speed with which it will return to normal levels., Global supply chains first disrupted by the pandemic remain stressed, further exacerbated by Russia\u2019s unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine., With nearly 370,000 jobs currently unfilled, Ontario is facing a generational labour shortage with the lowest rate of unemployment since 1989., And unprecedented spending throughout the pandemic has created new fiscal challenges here in Ontario and across Canada that will require prudent economic management in the months and years to come., It is sometimes easy to consider these challenges in the abstract, but they have real and significant consequences on the lives of hard-working people and businesses., People are now paying more for everyday goods like groceries and gas, putting increased strain on household budgets, particularly for low-income families. Long-planned vacations are being put on hold as small family pleasures like a meal out at a favourite local restaurant become just a little out of reach., Businesses of all sizes are struggling to find the skilled women and men they need to grow, or the parts they need to take on more orders. Amidst this scarcity, the rising cost of labour and supplies may in turn increase the cost of goods being sold to consumers., Taken together, these looming fiscal and economic challenges cannot be understated or ignored. They must be confronted head-on., And there are no easy solutions., In response to growing inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada has started to increase its policy interest rate. While the full impact of this response is currently unclear, Ontario, like the rest of Canada and North America, must be prepared for the possibility of a near-term economic slowdown., Even as the province, country and world navigate a period of uncertainty, your government can be sure of the fundamentals of a strong, vibrant and successful province and economy., Low taxes and a competitive business environment that attracts investments and creates good jobs., A highly skilled workforce prepared for the jobs of today and tomorrow., Roads, highways and other critical infrastructure that help get goods and services to market sooner., Livable and safe communities with good schools and high-quality hospitals and long-term-care homes, as well as convenient transit options., Over the past four years, Ontario has come so far., The province\u2019s automotive and manufacturing sectors are breathing new life. Shovels are in the ground on transformational transit and transportation projects. More women and men are entering rewarding careers in the skilled trades., Now is the time to redouble these efforts. | Bills: Bill 2, Bill 1"}, "transcript 2023-11-20": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2023-11-20", "summary": "Transcript from: 2023-11-20 | Speakers: Mr. Billy Pang, Ms. Christine Hogarth, Ms. Bhutila Karpoche, Hon.

I\u2019ll be splitting my time, of course, with the Associate Minister of Housing, as well as the parliamentary assistant to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing., Today, obviously, we\u2019re talking about Bill 134, which is the Affordable Homes and Good Jobs Act. The bill is realistically titled and is simply put, Mr. Speaker. First, I think it\u2019s important to just talk about some of the things that we\u2019ve been doing on housing and why we\u2019ve had to bring forward this bill. It\u2019s not just about housing, I will say; it\u2019s also about helping unleash opportunity, specifically in St. Thomas. But I\u2019ll get to all of that., As you know, Speaker, we have been focused since 2018 on how we can improve the environment to build more homes across the province of Ontario.

We heard a lot from colleagues opposite that somehow this would be a very undemocratic process, that the process the government was bringing in hadn\u2019t been used before, that it would change democracy forever, it would crash the Western hemisphere, it would kill Westminster parliamentary traditions and revert us back to prior to the Magna Carta and the world would fall apart. | Bills: Bill 5, Bill 29, Bill 55, Bill 59, Bill 39, Bill 56, Bill 51, Bill 3, Bill 26, Bill 36, Bill 124, Bill 7, Bill 54, Bill 43, Bill 31, Bill 125, Bill 218, Bill 23, Bill 57"}, "transcript 2023-06-06": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2023-06-06", "summary": "Transcript from: 2023-06-06 | Speakers: Mr. Jeff Burch, Mr. Billy Pang, Ms. Christine Hogarth, Mr. Terence Kernaghan, Mr. Rob Flack, Hon.

I understand that the government is trying to work fast, to try to get ahead of something that\u2019s affecting all of us. Does it go far enough? We\u2019ll be exploring it within this debate., Identity theft, fraud and cyber attacks are serious problems that can have devastating impacts on individuals. We all know this. Ontarians need to be able to trust that their personal information and data is safe and their privacy is protected in our public and private institutions. When someone steals your personal information, like your name, social security number or banking information, they can pretend to be you. In 2021, Canadians lost over $230 million to online fraud, including identity theft, that we know of. The complexity involved with trying to recover from identity theft takes loads of time and money and, of course, incredible stress., When a cyber attack happens to an organization, they can not only steal massive amounts of personal data; they can shut down critical operations. When hackers hold this data hostage in a ransomware attack, it\u2019s been reported that the cost of Canadian companies averages about $1.9 million per incident., Artificial intelligence: Who knows how much it will evolve? We know in our attempts to make life easier and for us to continue to increasingly rely on technology, we\u2019re solving a lot of problems, but we\u2019re also creating others. It\u2019s hard to keep up. Once we have opened Pandora\u2019s box and it\u2019s open, once you commit to certain acts or train an AI or do whatever it is, you can\u2019t step it back. At some point, we all know that this AI is going to overtake us in many different ways, so it\u2019s important to have a handle on that. Again, it\u2019s important for us to be discussing this here in our Legislature, and I\u2019m hoping these conversations are happening across the world., First off, I\u2019m going to be relying on information provided by different individuals, namely an expert in the field named John Wunderlich. I appreciate the research and comments on the bill he has provided. As well, I would like to thank the Law Commission of Ontario, who have made a detailed submission to the government on Bill 194. In the submission, they made 11 concrete recommendations that the government could implement to improve this legislation, and I hope that the government will take their recommendations very seriously., We also heard from one of the members opposite that this seems to be legislation in flux and movement, so again, I really hope that they will be listening to the experts as we see this move forward and that the regulations that will finally come will be in consultation with those that have our best interests at heart., Like many government bills, this here is largely a regulatory framework. Notwithstanding what was said earlier, we see this has been a pattern in a lot of government regulation. We don\u2019t know exactly what all the regulations are going to be or if they will be enough to deal with the challenges of cyber security or emerging AI. There\u2019s also, again, no regulation on the private sector, which is just as susceptible to data breaches., So when you look at schedule 1, it\u2019s about enhancing digital trust in the public sector and what safe cyber security measures public agencies will have to follow to protect the data that\u2019s in their hands. The problem is that smaller municipalities have said they don\u2019t have the finances and capacity to manage this on their own. What are the assurances being made to Ontarians that measures will be in place to ensure that our data is safe with third-party and, perhaps, foreign corporations that will actually be handling the data?, Why do I say this? It\u2019s very easy for governments, and especially this government, to increasingly privatize as well as download. So what we\u2019re seeing here is the government essentially telling municipalities, \u201cHey, look, this is important, but ultimately figure it out yourself.\u201d There\u2019s no money attached to it. There\u2019s no real plan to help them with that. So while we may all agree this is a very, very important issue, I think more leadership is needed in this area, and something a little more prescriptive, and I\u2019ll be getting to that a little later., Our libraries, schools and hospitals need support with resources, training and building capacity for better cyber security\u2014again, not just slapping them with extra responsibility without any leadership or means of implementing these changes that they\u2019re sort of alluding to. We have seen this before. We all know how it can end. The government is, again, downloading these responsibilities without funding. They love to tell municipalities what to do. I mean, we have seen that in a lot of legislation, but I\u2019m not going to talk about that today., Schedule 2 makes changes to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act applies to the provincial government, universities, colleges, hospitals and designated entities. These changes would expand the reporting requirements when there has been a data breach and make our institutions undertake proactive measures to avoid thefts, losses and other unauthorized uses of personal information., 1710, While the schedule sets a few standards, none of the sections propose substantive information. Essentially, what it says is, \u201cTrust us. We will make those rules and regulations.\u201d As I\u2019ve mentioned before, when you listen to some of the government members, it\u2019s almost as if cyber security will cease to exist if this passes into law. Let\u2019s not over-promise here, right?, The protections around those under 18, of course, are important, but also very vague. So we want to hear the real content on how they will be protecting the digital information of people under 18., Schedule 2 does add in whistle-blower protections\u2014which is good\u2014if someone believes there is a contravention or there will be an apparent contravention of the act. The complainant can request confidentiality and the Information and Privacy Commissioner would not be able to reveal the identity of the complainant. Of course, we want to protect our whistle-blowers, who are often putting themselves at risk to protect all of us. Again, that\u2019s something that\u2019s good. It would also allow the Information and Privacy Commissioner to consult with other privacy commissioners and enter into agreements with them to coordinate and publish guidelines. That\u2019s good, too., Canada has become a target for cyber and ransomware attacks. We always have, but we continue to see increasing attacks here. Approximately 9% of Ontario municipalities have experienced a significant cyber breach in just the past two years alone. In Canada, and particularly Ontario, there have been several notable cyber security incidents that highlight vulnerabilities at various levels of governance and private organizations. One significant case involved the Better Outcomes Registry and Network, otherwise known as BORN Ontario. In May 2023, a cyber attack exposed the personal health information of 3.4 million people, including details relating to pregnancy care and newborns. The breach underscored the need for more robust data protection measures, as the compromised data included sensitive information such as names, addresses and health card numbers., When the Toronto Public Library was attacked last year, and more recently the Hamilton Public Library, people\u2019s lives were put on hold. With no means to use a public computer or Internet at their local branch, many were left without a way to search for a job or housing. I know I was at the library following this attack and saw what it did to the system. Others were left disconnected from staying connected to friends and families abroad, or had their studies significantly curtailed by the outages., When the city of Hamilton was attacked, it was so paralyzing. Imagine that firefighters were using Google Maps to respond to calls for help. So they have major, major damage, you find, when you have a cyber attack. In the case, of course, of our first responders, it could be life-and-death results. It also, of course, had financial impacts. The city of Hamilton\u2019s staff were unable to process approximately $36 million in preauthorized property tax payments, among other things. Furthermore, when the Toronto Public Library was attacked, it\u2019s believed to have exposed the data of their own employees going back to 1998., The preamble of the bill states that Ontario recognizes the value of enhancing Ontario\u2019s privacy safeguards through increased transparency and independent oversight. If this were true, it would include privacy and protection for employees both in the public and private sectors, which cannot be legislated federally except for employees under the federal labour code. In fact, employees in Ontario are the least likely to have privacy protection at work compared to other provinces and territories., Again, we see a lot of good things in the legislation but the government really needs not to just look at the public side, but the private side. As I\u2019ve said earlier, a lot of our data is there and we need to protect literally everyone., Vaping detectors: Again, schools in Brampton and Mississauga installed vape detectors in student washrooms. Privacy concerns arose as a result of this when it was discovered that these devices were actually capable of detecting audio-capturing capabilities of the devices in a private space. The vape detectors came after the province announced a three-year $30-million fund to allow school boards to purchase the detectors., This is an example of how a privacy impact assessment is important prior to using technology with data-capturing technology. Of course, you would expect that parents would have wanted to know exactly what this was in advance and, as you can imagine, there were concerns that were raised., The importance of funding public institutions: Speaker, this legislation puts all the responsibility on public entities to develop in-house AI and other measures. But we know our schools are so starved by this government that they can\u2019t even meet the basic needs, in many cases, of our students. How can we possibly expect and require them to do this without lots and lots of outsourcing to, of course, private companies? We have not been talking about private companies in this legislation., So what are we doing? We\u2019re setting up schools and municipalities to open the door to foreign companies to have access to private data, including our children\u2019s data. Data that is out there cannot be retracted. Data that is stolen can\u2019t be recovered. Without proper funding, contracts will be given out, once again, to private hands from our public coffers. So, again, why no assurances and protections with regard to privately held data?, It seems odd that we\u2019re saying our public institutions must adhere to these standards, but we know they can\u2019t and will have to rely on private companies that aren\u2019t being included here. We know the public institutions are so cash-strapped they won\u2019t be able to develop their own cyber security systems and, of course, will be relying on third parties., I\u2019m going to read some excerpts from privacy expert and data protection expert John Wunderlich, who, again, we thank for weighing in on this matter. Here\u2019s a quote from him:\n\u201cBill 194 has been introduced in the current context of the ongoing evolution of cyber security and privacy threats and the explosive growth of artificial intelligence., \u201cIt is worth noting that the bill does not make amendments to the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy-MFIPPA (the sister act to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act-FIPPA). Hopefully, this can be addressed as the bill goes through the legislative process.\u201d And of course, you know they\u2019ve left a lot of this to regulation, so this is something they should be looking at., \u201cIt must be said that if one of the government\u2019s objectives in the bill were to improve cyber security and privacy protections for Ontarians, this would have been a golden opportunity to introduce private sector legislation to provide a made-in-Ontario solution that could supplement and extend the protections offered by federal legislation and ensure that Ontarians have robust and equivalent protection in both the public and private sectors. In particular, the government of Ontario\u2019s failure to protect employees\u2019 privacy is a long-standing issue highlighted by the gaps in this legislation., \u201cEmployees in Ontario do not have legislation that protects their privacy in either the public or the\u201d private \u201csector. Public sector privacy protections were removed in 1995, making Ontario unique among Canadian provinces in that it does not protect the privacy of civil servants at work. It is also the case that, due to employment being in provincial jurisdiction, federal private sector privacy legislation does not protect employees in Ontario.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we are doing things here in Ontario, since we can\u2019t rely fully on the federal legislation., \u201cThe bill has two significant elements. Schedule 1, \u2018Enhancing Digital Security and Trust Act,\u2019 addresses cyber security issues, the use of artificial intelligence systems, the impact of digital technology on children, and some general provisions, all of which will be addressed below., \u201cSchedule 2, \u2018Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,\u201d amends the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,\u201d 1990., Here\u2019s a bit of a comparison of how non-prescriptive this is, as compared to similar legislation happening elsewhere:\n\u201cBill 194 is 51 pages long. From a content perspective, that is about 17 pages in English, with a matching section in French. If you think, \u2018This seems a bit perfunctory, given the complicated nature of cyber security, digital protection of children, and privacy,\u2019 you would be right. It seems to me that the entire bill could be summarized by saying that the government recognizes the importance of issues and will, therefore, write and implement regulations sometime in the future to deal with them. \u2018Just trust us and pass the bill.\u2019, \u201cWhen you compare this to the four years of discussion that went into creating the 458-page EU Artificial Intelligence Act, it comes up short, literally and figuratively., \u201cCloser to home\u201d\u2014don\u2019t look at Europe; just look at what\u2019s going on federally. I think that they\u2019re essentially allowing the feds to eat their lunch here. But what did John say? He said, \u201cCloser to home, Bill C-27, which includes the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, is 148 pages (or 74 pages in English) but is accompanied by more than 100 civil society, industry, and expert submissions on the provisions and issues of the bill., \u201cCyber security, \u201cThis part of Bill 194 boils down to a requirement for the government to make regulations governing cyber security. | Bills: Bill 213, Bill 124, Bill 201, Bill 194, Bill 173"}, "transcript 2024-04-17": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2024-04-17", "summary": "Transcript from: 2024-04-17 | Speakers: Mr. Jeff Burch, Mr. Billy Pang, Ms. Christine Hogarth, Hon.

Ted Arnott): Further debate? I recognize the member for Nickel Belt., M\nme\n France G\u00e9linas: Thank you, Speaker. If you\u2019ll allow me, I would like to say thank you. I was supposed to do my lead on Thursday afternoon. I would like to thank my House leader team, as well as the House leader from the government, for allowing me to postpone my lead to this morning. I attended my nephew\u2019s funeral Thursday afternoon. I was there when my nephew was born. My daughter used to babysit him and his brother. I was there when he graduated. He was a gifted mechanic, a really nice person. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 28, and it was gut-wrenching. I thank you for allowing me time to grieve with my family and attend his funeral. I will change the topic because I may start crying., Thank you, also, to everybody who reached out and offered me a word of encouragement and support. From both sides of the House, I received them, and it was very much appreciated. Thank you., Applause., M\nme\n France G\u00e9linas: To Bill 135: Bill 135 is a bill that will change how home care is managed and coordinated in Ontario. Our health care system has many parts: health promotion, disease prevention\u2014most people know about primary care, where you have a physician or a nurse practitioner who follows you. We know our hospital system, whether it be specialty care, pediatric care\u2014we have strong hospitals. We have palliative care. We have community mental health and addictions. We also have a part of this big system of care that is called home care., Home care has seen many changes in the way that it is governed and managed but not so many in the way that it is delivered. The way that it is managed is that there are basically three big groups of people who have needs and can live healthy and productive lives with the help of home care. We will start with the small one., Some people are born with severe disability or diseases right from birth, whether they need special G-tube feeding to be able to feed themselves or they need help with breathing. Often, those babies becoming kids becoming grown-ups will be sent home with home care. For a lot of people who have severe disability and health needs\u2014as I said, for breathing, for eating etc.\u2014they could be on home care for their entire life. If you have a disability, you may tap into what is called the Passport Program, where you will basically become an employer and hire your own people to come and provide home care to you. Home care can range from helping you get out of bed and into your wheelchair in the morning, transferring to a toilet, showering, preparing meals, eating\u2014all of the activities of daily living. So that\u2019s one part., The second part, which most adults will know, is post-discharge from hospitals\u2014the ones that are the best known are hip and knee surgeries. I will take them as an example, but there are many others. For hip and knee surgeries, in my day, you used to be admitted to a hospital two or three days before and have the surgery. For a knee, you stayed for a week; for a hip, you stayed at least for 10 days\u2014none of that anymore. All of the assessment is done ahead of time. They show you the exercises that you\u2019ll have to do. They fit you for a walker or crutches, or whatever needs to be done. All of this is done before surgery. More and more, the surgery will be done the same day. The day of the surgery, you will be able to go home\u2014or, at least, the next day or the following day. But the follow-up that used to happen in the hospital still needs to happen. You will have big surgical scars for which you will need a change of bandages. You will still need to be seen by a physiotherapist to make sure that you get your range of motion, you get your balance, you have full extension in your knees, you learn how to go up and down the stairs and how to manage on uneven ground\u2014all of this. More and more of this in our home care is what we call bundled care; that is, you go home and you have a bundle of care where you already know that the nurse will come to see you on this day, this day and this day to change the bandages. The physiotherapist will come to see you to teach you exercises, then on day 5, she\u2019ll start to teach you range of motion so that you get ready for stairs etc. etc. Bundled care happens after surgical or in-patient admission into the hospital. | Bills: Bill 154, Bill 93, Bill 90, Bill 156, Bill 153, Bill 146, Bill 180, Bill 8, Bill 124, Bill 135, Bill 23, Bill 155"}, "transcript 2023-05-15": {"type": "transcript", "id_number": "2023-05-15", "summary": "Transcript from: 2023-05-15 | Speakers: Mr. Jeff Burch, Mr. Billy Pang, Ms. Christine Hogarth, Mr. Terence Kernaghan, Ms. Teresa J.
